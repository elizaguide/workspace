Preparation 1: Welcome to Ultra Presence
--------------------
<v ->Hi there, welcome to your Quest</v> of embodying Ultra Presence. My name is Juan Pablo Barahona; you can call me JuanPa please; that's how my family, my close people call me. And I am so grateful to be in this journey with you. I have been in the journey of personal development, spirituality, embodiment, energy, since I am nine years old, and not because I wanted to. I was almost forced into it. At this time I was a normal child, beautiful family, felt good in my life, and all of a sudden, from one day to the other, my brother got sick; he had epilepsy, a very very deep epilepsy that got his whole body frozen, vegetable, in around one month. We took him to all the doctors, everyone, not only in Costa Rica but around the world, and they all said he had one or two years to live, and there was nothing else to do. They were giving him 30 pills of full chemicals, and he was still having epilepsy. At this moment, my family wouldn't accept this; they were already in like spiritual path, and they had their own little practices here and there, but this really got them to go deep and explore everything, all the healing technologies, all the shamans, all the energetic work, everything you can imagine we would try, everything related to nutrition, meditation, yoga, Qigong, kinesiology, all of it, everything we could. And of course he was my best friend; he was like always there for me. So I was doing everything with him because I wanted to support him. He was having a really, really tough time. So through all this work, I was doing all types of meditations and yoga and drinking my smoothies at a very young age, and doing the smoothies for my brother. Like it was my motivation 'cause it went beyond trying to be a good human, it was like I want to support my family and my brother especially. And with time I tried to fill that gap that my brother was leaving because imagine, for my family it was so hard to all of a sudden have your son in the bed, almost can't even move, and he's dying slowly. So unconsciously, I had all this pressure on myself of course, so I was the best student; I was the best athlete; I was the best son. I embodied the best version of myself to try to fill in this gap and balance a little bit that emptiness that my family was feeling. I was almost like the perfect child, the angel, but this angel wasn't really an angel; inside of me, I had so much going on. I had so much frustration; I had so much fear, so much anger, so many emotions I wasn't even allowing myself to go into because I had to be the perfect child. So this went on until I was 15 years of age, and I was feeling there was something more. And I started exploring my spiritual path 'cause I was fully in spirituality, but I started exploring with certain substances, medicinal mushrooms and things that would alter my consciousness and open me up, and this worked for a while. The problem is I was my own shaman. I was my own guide. So of course I had a lot of awakening, but at the same time I started getting lost in this exploration of substances until I got lost in party. It became party; it became a disconnection; it became almost a numbing of what I was going through. Everything I was feeling with my brother, with my family, with myself, I put under the pillow, and with these substances, I would numb myself. At 17 years of age, I was completely lost. I was completely lost in my own depression, in my own drama. I wanted to leave this life, I felt completely disconnected from my family, from myself, from life. I was ready to go. And I found myself with a knife on my wrist; I wasn't even in my body almost. I just remember this vision of seeing the knife on my wrist and feeling the palpitations of my heart. I was sweating; I was feeling so much emptiness inside of me; I felt so lonely. My heart beating at 1000 kilometers per second, sweating, cold, and completely ready to leave this life. In that moment I heard a voice inside of me, a deep "No," so deep I let go of the knife and fell on the ground, started crying like a baby, crumpled up in fetal position and cried for hours. I cried for hours, opened up so deeply. And as soon as I could, I started crawling towards the phone to call my dad, and ask him for help. I realized I really needed help, and that now I was ready to start my real spiritual journey. So we found this spiritual community that it was all about getting raw and real. That it was all about embodiment. That it was all about coming to the simplicity of life without trying to be, without trying to fake, just really living from that place of your essence and learning how to listen to your soul. After being six months in Costa Rica, there was an extension of this community in Italy where actually this community was born. And I went there and lived two years learning everything I could, not only for myself but then how to support others. I wanted to help others bring out everything that they were carrying, everything that was disconnecting them from their essence, from who they were, from their presence. And of course while I applied all this for me, I was helping others. And this is where I found my purpose: I love helping others; I really feel others; I love supporting others on their path, and in this path of inner mastery, I found my purpose. It was about helping others; it was about supporting others; it was about being raw and real with myself, being as human as I could, and sharing that experience with others so I could support them on their spiritual path too. Around my twenties, I came back to Costa Rica where I became the leader of this community of 60 people, and I was there at very young age supporting them and helping them rise. This really empowered me and really connected me with my purpose deeper 'cause I could see it. It was not only talking, but it was walking the talk; it was living with them. We spent two years working together. I wouldn't even go home; it was, that was my home; that was my family. I was fully there with them and of course with myself, always evolving, always growing. So I became obsessed with this. I became so passionate to see others thrive. I became so passionate with expanding myself even more in every area of my life that as soon as I got out, I started studying everything. I had already started with my brother, Kinesiology, Chinese medicine, yoga, Qigong, energetics, everything, NLP, hypnosis. Everything I would run into that was around personal development of spirituality, I was fully in, and I mean fully obsessed because I had found my passion. After 10 years of studies in different parts of the world, I was ready to open up and have my own healing center and have my own space where people would come and connect with themselves and give them everything I could for them to expand. I got married; I had a beautiful son; I started really expanding as a family, as as a parent, as a father. I started opening up more and more to the lessons of life, and my business started growing at the same time, so much that from a little center, it became bigger, bigger, and bigger, until we would hold up to 200 people that would come to work with us at the same time. And again, when I had settled everything, when I was in my comfortable zone, again I went through a deep crisis that I'm going to tell you after in this Quest. And that opened me up to my next level, that opened me up to start expanding, working with Mindvalley, traveling all over the world; it's been seven years that I've been traveling with not a home, just sharing this Quantum Flow Method with the world. All of a sudden I received this email that I had been recommended to Mindvalley, because they were coming to do an A-Fest, a beautiful festival that they do all over the world, and it was in Costa Rica. So I'm in; I'm going to go and share with them everything I can and guided a cacao ceremony, and I was fully hooked with Mindvalley. I loved everyone from Vishen, and the whole Tribe and team, to everyone that attended; it's such a high-vibrational space. I was so happy; it's like it was coming back home for me. And through Mindvalley was really where I came from being a spiritual teacher that teaches yoga and healing and shamanism and everything I taught, to going deeper into, let's go into the flow state. Let's help entrepreneurs take their business to the next level. Let's help the leaders of the world connect with their heart and go deeper into their purpose, through their body, through their mind, through their nervous system. I actually got obsessed around their nervous system, not only because my brother, that was his big, big problem, it was in his nervous system, but then I realized that everything I was carrying, all the wounds, all that body memory from my past, everything that was holding me back was related to my nervous system. So I started starting quantum physics, neuroscience, neuroplasticity, quantum biology, everything I could to understand the body, the mind, and the energy at a scientific level. I became a scientist, obsessed with "I want to demystify spirituality." It wasn't enough for me anymore to just be in a meditation state where I was in the nothingness and into the wholeness. It wasn't enough to feel love and help others feel love and go into the purpose. I also wanted to understand. And this is where everything I had studied, all the ancestral wisdom got and united with the most advanced science. And this is where Quantum Flow Method was born. This is the methodology I'm sharing with you to embody Ultra Presence. It's a methodology that works deeply in the nervous system, that expands you from that contracted nervous system, stress nervous system into a nervous system that's opened, that's allowing the electricity, the energy, to flow through all the way up into your brain to wake up dormant parts of your brain, to wake up your pineal gland, your pituitary gland, all those magical glands that we have available, but if we don't wake them up, we won't embody our full potential. So this methodologies inspired all those universal principles, of all the ancestral wisdom I had worked with; plus we added the science, and we allowed this when it mixed to open up to different practices, different ways to approach the nervous system, different ways of exploration, so we would see what would this create not only in my own life, but in hundreds of clients from all over the world. And the results we were having were really amazing. Working with amazing entrepreneurs that were stuck in their own little world and couldn't take their business to the next level. Working with elite athletes that wanted to really step it up and weren't able to. Working with spiritual teachers, healers, yoga masters, like all kinds of people that were committed to their purpose, that were committed to serve, that were committed to to be a better version of themselves. Working with all kinds of people that all had one thing in common: they wanted to live their life from their highest self, the highest version of themself. They knew they were living in a comfortable zone. They knew there was something else for them. They knew there were blind spots that they couldn't see that was holding them back. And that's where Quantum Flow came in, and worked through the unconscious mind, through the nervous system to release, to open up, to rewire the body and the mind into success. So we are using the most advanced mindsets, with the most advanced embodiment techniques, with the most advanced breath work; when they mix together, wow, you will feel it in your body. It will bring you right into your temple, into your body, where you are living your full potential, where you are shining bright, where you feel full creativity, where you feel full energy, where you wake up inspired with that drive that you are unstoppable. All that will wake up in you through the process; this is what Ultra Presence is. When you're present, you are tapping into your full potential, not only in your body, but in every area of your life. So in the first part of this Quest, you are going to understand the science and the art of embodiment of Ultra Presence, and how that relates to every area of your life, how that relates to your nervous system. In part number two, you will learn a lot of biohacks, inner technologies, techniques that will help you rewire your nervous system back to Ultra Presence. I will share with you the science and art of alchemy, of transformation, and invite you to accept the alchemist that you are, how you can transform any situation in your life into an opportunity. Any challenge can become an opportunity. We build that inner resiliency through your nervous system, so you feel unstoppable. And in part three, we will see the relationship of the nervous system, of each one of the nervous plexuses that we will be opening up, and releasing whatever tension is there, and how that is related to your energetic system. Your electromagnetic field, which is the field of manifestation, is your inner magnetism. How can you cultivate that inner magnetism that attracts all the people, things, money, energies, everything that's available to you when you are in your highest vibration, when you are radiating from this place of presence from within. And of course everything I teach you, no matter how deep we go into science, and we do a lot of embodiment practices, we'll be practicing a lot so you can feel it. Not only know it, not only work with the mindset, but feel it in your body; embody it so you can take it to your life; embody it so you can allow it to be your lifestyle; it's a way of living. This Quest is not only an experience; it's not only a journey; it's a way of life. You find your own flow, what helps you enter that flow state of Ultra Presence. You are unique, and what you need is unique. And this is what I am offering you through this methodology; you will find what works for you. We're all different; it's all perfect; it's accepting that and really understanding what is your own flow. So let's get in the flow now. I invite you to start taking action and just journal around what is your intention? Now that you heard me a little bit around that introduction, I would love to hear from you; what is your intention? Why are you here? This way I can support you even more on your journey. Remember, we have a beautiful community; we have a beautiful group. I invite you to join us; ask questions; share photos; share videos, whatever works for you; please let us know about you. We want to hear from you. This sharing from each one of you is what creates the electricity in the group. We are electrical beings; we are magnetic beings, electric magnetic beings that share with others and support each other. So every time you're sharing, you're sharing energy; you're sharing yourself. You're inviting others to do the same, and that starts waking up the energy in you, in each one of us. That starts creating that heart, that connection between us all, and of course this electricity that we're creating between us, this connection, is connected to your own electricity that flows through your nervous system. Your nervous system is pure light; you're going to see how fascinating you are inside of you and how really light is traveling through you all the time. Once we expand this electricity, once we expand our capacity to open up to this electricity, the more energy flows through you, the more light flows through you, the more love, the more money, the more prosperity, all of it; it's all related to your state of Ultra Presence. I am so grateful to share this journey with you. Thank you for saying yes to embodiment. Thank you for saying yes to your highest self. Thank you for saying yes to your full potential. Thank you for being here. May the journey begin. See you soon.

Part 1 - The Power of Presence

====================

LESSON 1: The Fundamentals of Embodying Presence
--------------------
<v ->Hello; hello, everyone.</v> So excited to start this journey with you. Welcome to lesson number one. We are going deep. So, the whole idea of this is creating presence in yourself with every part of your being. That is what presence is. And what we will see in this Quest is really about how presence is actually influencing every area of your life, from the way you look, how you feel, what you're thinking about, how that reflects in your business, in your relationships, in your purpose, in your spirituality. Every layer of your being is or in coherency with the full presence, and that is expanding in every area of your life. Or there's incoherency, and you think in a certain way, and you're feeling in another way, and you want to do something, but you procrastinate, and you self-sabotage, and you get distracted, and you have all these goals that maybe you are not accomplishing. And there is a reason why we are not present in our lives. So, welcome to the life you deserve. Welcome to this gift for yourself that you have said yes to. I want to invite you to be fully present in this Quest. I know we have phones; we have children; we have business; we have so much going on. Whenever you're dedicating time for this, even if it's five minutes what you can dedicate, that's what you had; be fully present. Please commit to that. I commit 100% to be fully here for you. I invite you to do the same, so you can start training yourself. And everything we're doing in this Quest is just going to be taking to the quest for life. Another temptation you can have is always check other courses that are happening in Mindvalley, because it's so good, right? There's amazing teachers, amazing leaders here that can help you in so many areas of your life. I invite you to focus yourself and really go deep in one part, so you really get it, and you're not mixing with other theories, other philosophies, which they all complement. But once you get into something, and you really get it, and you really feel it in your body, you will see that also any other course you want to do, you will be fully present for that, and you will get 10x of what you will get if you're just kind of all over the place. I call it the the hummingbird disease, kind of thing. And it's like the hummingbird that goes everywhere, having a little bit here and there, but really there is no depth. We are not going deep in any of the areas that you are really wanting and craving, and you are so ready to go in. So, in order for us to start understanding what's going on, there's a reason why we go into destraction or procrastination. There's always a reason. And once you understand it, once you understand the science and the art of this, you will be so loving with yourself. You will be so compassionate; your life will be in flow because those parts of you are understanding what's going on; you're going to go to the core of it all. You're going to release it, and you're going to have all the technologies, all the science, all the system to help you always be in that alignment. Let's start with step number one. Observation. So once you have really cultivated that observer within you, once you have really nurtured that part of you, that capacity to just see what's going on. There's nothing good or bad; there's nothing I should be doing, I have to do. It doesn't come from this place of, like, hard masculine energy, trying to be structured and systemized, right? That is the discipline we have been used to. I'm going to invite you in this Quest to open up to blissipline, cultivating all this practice through bliss, through enjoying the practice, and this happens through observation. When we observe, we take a step back. You're just watching the movie, you know, eating your popcorn there and having your smoothie or your superfood coffee. And I'm going to teach you the best superfood coffee recipe ever. It's going to help you a lot be in presence if you drink coffee, right? You are there just observing, just looking at your life. And this is something that at the beginning is hard because we're used to reacting. We live in survival mode, and this comes from our nervous system. It's beyond even a mindset. Your nervous system, it's like 100% full on. And what happens is, like, anything that happens outside, we react. So with the observer, we're cultivating what we call the parasympathetic nervous system, your vagus nerve. All the technology that you have inside your body, inside your brain, in order to take a step back and just observe, "Hmm, where are those thoughts coming from? Interesting. Hmm. My mind is going crazy right now. What's going on? Okay, okay; let me just be present for this. Let me just breathe." And I'm going to show you all the different exercises you can do and everything you can be present into for observing the mind, because we have been used to be guided by the mind. The mind is the master of your house, right? Well, as you know, you are not your mind. You have a mind; you have a brain; you have a mind, and you can cultivate and program your mind in the way you want. But we can only do this if we observe; if we don't cultivate this capacity to observe what thoughts are going on, where are these thoughts coming from and how can I change them? How can I recodify them? How can I rewire them? This happens through presence, and it's like going to a gym, right? I call it the soul gym. You're going into this, like, soul quest, learning to live from your soul, learning to live from your highest self, learning to live from the highest version of you. This happens through observation. Once you're there, and thoughts are coming through, "Okay, interesting, those thoughts, huh? Okay, let me, let me observe them as clouds. I don't identify with them; I just see them pass by. I'm not my thoughts." And I actually can journal on them, so we can go deeper why these thoughts have been programmed in your mind. I promise you, you can cultivate a mind that naturally produces positive thoughts; naturally they happen. It's not something you are, "Positive affirmations, let me connect with that." "Positive thinking." Those are great, but that's not getting to the core of it all. We can go to the core, to the roots of it, so you can be a positive thought creator generator. Then, we have emotions. What happens with emotions, it's like roller coaster, right? "Now, I'm happy. Yeah, best day ever. Oh, now I'm sad. Oh my God, everything's going... World is against me." Like, "Oh, now I'm angry and frustrated." Whatever the emotion is, we actually just let ourselves go into the roller coaster instead of learning to feel them. Of course, emotions are energy emotions. They're here to be felt and at the same time, they are the battery, the electricity of your nervous system, all, if we know how to use them, if we know when they come up. I'm going to show you how to transform them, how to use that anger, which can actually destroy, can create damage inside of you and outside of you, and sometimes damage that you can't really heal. It's hard, right? With relationships, even with yourself, we can fall in patterns of addictions and all kinds of stuff, just because we don't know how to deal with our emotions. Nobody taught us that. Actually, feeling angry is bad; being afraid is bad; being sad, it's like dramatic; all these beliefs that are not true, all the emotions are welcome, but we learn how to use them as energy with the first phase that is observation. "Let me just observe what's going on. Whoa, where is this anger coming from? Wow, I'm actually vibrating from this anger. Why do I feel so much fear? Whoa, interesting. Let me breathe into that fear. Wow, okay, JuanPa, it's all good; it's all good. Let's just breathe." I'm going to show you everything you can do through your body, through your breath, through your mindset, of course, but I'm just introducing you to this concept of, "You are not your thoughts; you are not your emotions," and you actually can use them for manifesting the life of your dreams, for being the most present being you can be for yourself, for your family, for your community, for your clients, for the world. Then, let's talk about presence in the body. How many times we're disconnected from our bodies? We're thinking so much; we're planning so much; we're strategizing so much, which is great at certain moments, but we are so much up here that we forget how our posture is; we forget how we're breathing. We forget how we're walking in space; we forget what type of energy we're emanating. Everything is energy, everything. Whatever you're calling into your life, whatever you want to manifest, wherever you want to take your life into is related to the energy that you're cultivating through your body, okay? So, how your body is, it's going to tell, of course, your subconscious mind if you are available for energy or not, if you are available for new ideas, if you are creative, if you are inspired. How would you feel if I was teaching you something right now, and I'm like, "Hi, everyone. Okay, I'm JuanPa. Welcome. It's all about presence, you know, and I'm going to teach you all this." You'll be just, "Put it off," right? It doesn't work for you. I'm not emanating that. You need to feel it, and it's something that goes beyond the words, and that is through your body. Your body is your temple. Your body is here to shine bright. You are actually energy; you are electricity, and this electricity emanates through your skin, through your hair, through your presence, anywhere you go. It's like a magnetism. You can be a radiant magnetic self, or you can be a dim person that's actually sucking energy from other people, needing other people, disconnected actually from everything that's available for you in that moment. So, just bringing that awareness to your posture, bringing that awareness to your breath. Am I breathing deep and slow and gentle, and sweet, sweet, loving breath, we call it. You want to bring love to every cell of your being. Presence is about love. Are we available to love through every breath? Are we available to abundance through every breath? Every breath is teaching our body, is letting our body know where we're at in life, how available are we. It's the unconscious way to let ourselves know how available and open we are to all the possibilities that are here for us. And of course, all these leads into spirituality. What is your connection with your highest self, with that energy that's available to you always? Call it God; call it infinite love; call it light; whatever works for you is perfect. The thing is, when we're too much in our minds and we're controlling our life, we are not present for what's available. You want to be creative; you want to be inspired; you want to inspire others; you want to open amazing successful businesses, have the most amazing relationships, be open and receptive to everything that's available to you right now, and that comes through your highest self. It's like the infinite possibilities, the quantum field of infinite possibilities is always there, sharing ideas, all the creativity you can imagine; it's always there available, but since we don't have our nervous system fully open for this electricity, this energy, to flow through, we are missing out on our full potential, and this is how we wrap it up and understand how, really, presence in every layer of your being will influence and actually expand and enhance every area of your life, coming to what we call "Be presence." So, it's not about anymore, like, "Let me try to be present. Let me have the discipline to be present in my life and write on my journal and do my exercise and do my breath and do my meditation" and all the hacks that we have, right? It's all the biohacks that I'm going to be sharing a lot with you through the Quest, too. All this can help you, but it's always coming from a place of, like, "I am presence." Beyond I am present, I am presence itself. I am the universe. I am this divine energy flowing through. I am already that; it's nothing to accomplish. it's nowhere to get to; it's nothing to try hard and push. It's not about pushing. It's about allowing; it's about observing. It's about being present with everything, so you allow this to flow through you. You become a channel of manifestation through this presence. And from this space of presence, I want to invite you to a very short exercise that will help you just be mindful, just be aware of the presence in your body right now. Please just find a comfortable sitting position where your spine is as straight as possible; your shoulders are back without forcing them; it's relaxed; there's no tension in your neck. Your jaw is relaxed; your facial muscles are relaxed; you're fully open and receptive. Just observe that through your body, and whenever you're ready, please close your eyes, and just start breathing deeply into your belly; allow the air to expand. When you inhale, it expands in your belly; it expands your ribs, and then when you exhale, just use that exhalation to relax, to observe if there's any tension in your body right now, maybe just scanning your body for a second. Am I carrying tension in my neck, my jaw, my shoulder? Any part of your body that's tense, allow it to relax through the exhalation. Allow the inhalation to go deep, soft, and gentle. It's like a sweet caress you're giving yourself from the inside out. And now from this place, let's bring even more presence now, let's start counting that your inhalation lasts the same as your exhalation. So, whenever you're ready, taking that sweet inhalation, in one, two, and three, and exhaling in one, two, three, inhaling, two, three, exhaling, two, three. If this is a good number for you, you can stay there, just counting that your inhalation lasts the same as the exhalation. You can expand it more to four, to five. Just observe that you are completely relaxed, open and receptive to this practice. Just allowing your mind to focus on the numbers, focus on your body, completely relaxed and present in your body. It's really enjoying that very simple practice of presence, focusing your mind. If any emotion comes up, just observe it again. "I'm here. I'm present." Allow yourself to feel it, knowing that you are not your emotions; you are not your body; you are not your mind. You are just the observer. And with so much gratitude, very gently coming back, very gently opening your eyes. Just observing if anything changed, observing how you're feeling; how's your mind after you focused it in the breath, in the counting. Just be the observer. No expectations. This is just the beginning. It's a very simple exercise. Of course, we're going to go way deeper. I'm going to teach you a lot of breath, a lot of different biohacks, so you can really go deep into what Ultra Presence means in every area of your life. Thank you; thank you; thank you so much for this lesson together. I hope you have a deeper understanding of how this is affecting you in every area of your life. And I invite you to start going deeper in observation. Just maybe journaling around what are the thoughts that are coming in my mind? Instead of them just being random thoughts, write them down. You'll laugh after when you see what kind of thoughts come in your head. Some of them don't even make sense. Just write them down. Look at your emotions. What is the emotions that predominate in your life? Just observe them; write 'em down. Know that that is happening, and we're going to shift it. Observe your body. How is your posture? How do you walk? How do you breathe? Just be the observer for now, and start knowing yourself and all these parts of you that you are going to be upgrading. I also invite you to do this exercise whenever you remember, during the day, "Oh, let me just breathe. Let me just observe what's going on. Let me just take a step back of what's going on in my life right now." That's going to help you so much start living from a place of responding to life instead of reacting. I invite you to join our community too. There's a beautiful community that wants to hear from you. You guys know I'm all about community, and I always see how community supports everyone on their own quest, in their own life. So, I invite you to just share about you, a photo, a video, a comment, whatever that works for you. Even if it's hard and challenging, that's part of being present, and owning that, and really embodying that in your life. Thank you again, everyone, for this time together. Thank you for being open and willing to go deeper into your life. Lesson two, we're going to go deeper into what is holding you back from present, understanding a little more why we have the behaviors we have and how we can shift them. Have a beautiful, beautiful day, and we'll see you very soon.

====================

LESSON 1: Meditation - Instant Presence

Please just find a comfortable sitting position where your spine is as straight as possible. Your shoulders are back without forcing them. It's relaxed. There's no tension in your neck. Your jaw is relaxed, your facial muscles are relaxed. You're fully open and receptive. Just observe that through your body. And whenever you're ready, please close your eyes and just start breathing deeply into your belly. Allow the air to expand. When you inhale, it expands in your belly, it expands your ribs, and then when you exhale, just use that exhalation to relax, to observe if there's any tension in your body right now, maybe just scanning your body for a second. Am I carrying tension in my neck? My jaw? 

A shoulder? Any part of your body that stands? 

Allow it to relax through the exhalation. Allow the inhalation to go 

Deep, soft, and gentle. It's like a sweet caress. You're giving yourself 

From the inside out. And now from this place, let's bring even more presence. Now let's start counting that your inhalation lasts the same as your exhalation. So whenever you're ready, 

Taking that sweet inhalation in one, two, and three, and exhaling in 1, 2, 3. Inhaling two, three, exhaling 

Two, three. If this is a good number for you, you can stay there just counting that your inhalation lasts the same as the exhalation. If you can expand it more to four to five, just observe that you are completely relaxed, open and receptive to this 

Practice. It's allowing your mind to focus on the numbers, focus on your body completely relaxed and present in your body. It's really enjoying that very 

Simple practice of presence, focusing your mind. If any emotion comes up, just observe it. Again, I'm here, I'm present. Allow yourself to feel it. Knowing that you are not your emotions. You are not your 

Body. You are not your mind. You are just the observer. And with so much gratitude, very gently coming back, very gently opening your eyes.

LESSON 2: Your Barriers to Presence
--------------------
<v ->Hola; hola, familia. Welcome back.</v> Here we are going deeper and deeper. Lesson two of this Quest. We are going to see what are the blockers? What is distracting us? What is creating that procrastination in our life that is not letting us be in full presence? Let me just ask you how did it go on the exercise of observation? Were you capable to just look at your life without judgment, without thinking good or bad, just being present on whatever was going on? Today we're going to go deeper into the science of presence just by observing why do we have these habits that are not letting us shine our full potential, be who we came to be on this earth? So, let's just start by seeing what's going on in our minds and why all of these blockages come up. When you understand the mind and you see that the mind is like a wild animal, let's say a wild horse that's running free. it has its own habits, does whatever feels that's good in the moment, and they're beautiful. They're amazing, right? Incredible. It's so nice to see them until you want to use them or have them to help you on your journey, right? So let's say the mind is like the horse, and you want to use this horse to get somewhere. But if it's a wild horse, how are you going to do that? It's going to be crazy even to get the horse, right? So it's important to go step by step and understand that the nature of an untamed mind is to be crazy, so to say. Thoughts everywhere. One here; one there. I'm saying I'm going to do something, and then I'm thinking about Facebook or Instagram, and I want to go check that out. And then I got lost two hours into that, and then I forgot what I was doing, and then I come back. And we come and go in this playfulness of the mind because we are not aware that the mind is actually taking control. So we have an uneducated mind that has done whatever it wants whenever it wants. Like, it's like a child, right? A child that's like in its own tantrum and does their own thing, right? So it's like bringing them back to understanding that there's nothing wrong. We don't have to go crazy on this or try to fight it. It's the first thing. It's observing that that's the nature of the mind. The mind is a computer but has had no programs, conscious programs. It's all been unconscious programs of whatever you've lived in your life, from your parents, your teachers, your friends, the people you surround yourself with. It's all a vibration. It's all a belief that has been set there. So, once we start looking at that and all these like behaviors that are not really nurturing us and not helping us go deeper into what we want to manifest, go deeper into who we really are in this life and our purpose. Of course, that's like so important to know that and then start applying the presence of, like, "Okay, yes, I want to go into social media, but now I am finishing what I said I was going to do." "Yes, I'm going to eat that chocolate cake." Right, all these sugar cravings that comes, especially when you're doing something, that it's there for you, it's like something deep that maybe scares you. It's the next step in your business, the next step in your relationship, something like that. And usually we are almost procrastinating and self-sabotaging because it's something new for us. So the mind is used to like every time something that brings you out of the comfortable zone, something that brings you out of the box, it's going to throw all those distractions in whatever way. That can be, again, sugar; that can be pornography; that can be social media; that can be looking at my WhatsApp and calling a friend, or whatever, watching the TV program that I wanted to watch. And now I just remember it was that time; it doesn't matter. So it's important to observe, if you say I am focusing on this, if it's 15 minutes or 30 minutes, or whatever that is, commit with love, with blissipline to do that, and just observe when the mind wants to get in the way and start nurturing that capacity to say, "I am here, and now, this is what's happening right now." At the beginning, it's hard, 'cause we're used to just go all over the place. But once you start doing that, you are just observing the thoughts, and they don't affect you. Okay, so this is the nature of the mind. And once we understand, we start going into the soul gym, so we can use the mind as a computer. Something that's even deeper is the unconscious mind. The unconscious mind is in your nervous system, right? It's actually in a substance that we call the grounding substance. This is the substance of the connective tissue of the nervous system. And this is where all the information since you were born, actually you were in the womb of the mother, everything that happened, all the microtraumas, in any way emotions that were too much, energies, experiences, anything that moved you and impacted your nervous system in whatever way. It doesn't have to be a big trauma. It can be microtrauma. All that is in your nervous system. And of course at the beginning, it doesn't affect you, but it accumulates with time. So what happens with time, you start having this grounding substance that's not as fluid, and there's not so much electricity passing through it. And this is because there are blockages, actually crystallized. This substance becomes crystallized, and then the electricity is not flowing as well. So electricity is life; electricity is presence; electricity is energy. And if you have all these blockages in your nervous system, of course you are going to be all over the place. The energy is going to be, you know, 10% instead of 100%. And then the energy is lost because there is not a master in the house that says the energy is flowing from the base of my spine all the way up into my brain. That's the kundalini energy. In quantum physics, we call it the inductance field. And you can open up for this energy to flow at its highest potential, so it's not only nurturing your nervous system; it's nurturing every muscle in your body; it's nurturing every organ in your body; it's nurturing your brain, your skin, and the energy that emanates all around you. Presence comes from the core of your being all the way out. But if you have still all these microtraumas in your nervous system, no matter how much mindset, no matter how much you do, you're always going to be touching the roof there. Because physically you're not being able to hold the amount of energy, creativity, inspiration, presence that's available for you right now. And as we said before, when there is very little presence of electricity in your nervous system because all these blockages that we're carrying, all this cellular memory that's still there, blocking us from really embodying the electricity. And of course we're going to be always looking for stimuli that will help us get through life. And we will have energy in the moment, but it's not the real energy that's coming from the cells of your being. The mitochondria is the battery of the cell, and we need to go all the way in there, start biohacking the mitochondria to bring it back to its natural state, for it to start emanating that energy, for it to influence also the nervous system that's being unblocked with everything that we're going to be doing. And this is going to open up more electricity, you creating your own energy, and then of course feeling better even physically, more presence, more energy, more ready to take action, to go deeper into your life, more resiliency. The more you build that resiliency inside of you, you are not living your life stressed out, and in reaction you're fully present, knowing that if a big challenge comes, you can take it. You're in that place of observation, of presence, where you become the mountain, strong, powerful, grounded mountain that can observe what's going on and respond to the situation in the highest way possible. It's a choice, but the choice comes from presence; that comes from the body also. And of course the body will affect the mind. You can have the most amazing mindsets that are very important, and we're going to go deep into that, but if you don't have the body, the electricity, the nervous system, to hold it, they're not going to be sustainable. You're not going to live in that longevity of manifestation in your life, keeping that evolution happening in every area of your life. So as we said before, your mind is all over the place. There are thoughts coming on and off. You have a foggy brain. You have actually leaks in your brain that that happens a lot because of not being present in our nervous system and in our lifestyle. And of course, if you are not aware of all these thoughts, and you are not cultivating the thoughts that are constructing the thoughts, that are creating the thoughts, that are expanding the thoughts of abundance in every area of your life, of course that's going to affect your emotions too. Because a thought comes in, and you're like, "Oh yeah, you're right. I won't; that's too big for me. It's too big of a vision. I can't do that. What am I thinking? I'm crazy." We go into these emotional patterns. Many times they start with a thought, and we nurture that thought because you are not aware, and all of a sudden, from one moment to the other, we're sad, or we're envying someone else, or we're jealous, or we're in a certain emotion that's actually affecting our vibration, our frequency, our presence, and that's affecting every area of our lives. So now that we're tapping into more of the wisdom of what's really going on behind the scenes, first of all, we're not going to judge ourselves anymore, or know that judgment is really not helping. You're not going to compare yourselves to others. You're not going to get lost in these loops, in these dramas, in these suffering patterns that are useless and are caused because we are not present; we are not conscious of what's going on. It's like cancer. When you analyze cancer, cancer begins, we all have cancer in the cells in our body. What happens is through our lifestyle, through our thoughts, through our emotions, we're feeding that cancer, or we're actually healing it and recovering ourselves from it. So that thought is like a cancer. It starts with that negative thought, which you weren't aware of, that affects the emotions, which now you're aware of because all of a sudden you're feeling it, and it's not feeling that good. That's going to affect your body, your posture, your breath, how you act in the world; that's going to affect your energy and your spiritual connection, which is the most important, your connection with your highest self. Presence is all about highest self and being open and receptive to whatever is available to us in the moment. But you see how it's all built up, very very small, until it becomes huge, and you're like, "Oh my God, when did I get lost? Why am I feeling so bad? Why are things not working in my life?" It's time to start asking yourself those questions. Why are all these thoughts coming in right now? Let me journal on that. Let me observe where these thoughts are coming from. Why am I having these thoughts of not being good enough, not being capable of doing something, not being able to really embody my dreams? Where is that part coming from? I can assure you, that is coming from your past somewhere. And that's why we're here on this Quest, for you to know yourself in order to change any blind spot that has been there without you even knowing, in order to you to expand completely into this full potential that is your natural state. Now that we know this, we're going to be, "Oh, okay, interesting. Why is that coming up? Let me see where the not good enough is coming from. Where did I feel not good enough the first time in my life?" And we start questioning all these behaviors that are supposed to be natural. They're part of our personality. Our personality has been created. Our personality is not like a stamp you put and stays there forever. It's the ego. It has been constructed. And we can recreate it; we can align it with our highest self in order for us to live fully in presence. Perfecto. So I think it's enough of philosophy and science for now. Let's go into embodiment. I always love mixing embodiment with mindset and all this philosophy in order for you to feel it in your body, in order for it to become part of the cellular memory that you want to start cultivating. Remembering, presence is your natural state. So I'm going to ask you please to find a comfortable sitting position and really be aware of that posture. Remember, shoulders are back; you are relaxed. There is a little golden string pulling your head up. You're like floating. Yes, instead of the gravity bringing you down, you're almost floating up. That is opening up to more presence in your life. Then remember to expand your belly when you're inhaling. This is bringing that signal to your nervous system that you're safe, that you can breathe long and deep, and that everything is okay. It's a signal we're sending for the nervous system to start calming down, back to its natural state of presence. So just observing that, I invite you to close your eyes. Please breathe through your nose. The nose, it's another signal. If you can breathe through your nose, your body takes that as, "Oh, okay, I can relax. I am open and receptive. This feels good." It's actually getting all the way into your parasympathetic nervous system, which is relaxed, and digest and just be present and aware. So take your time, come into that breath counting, that your inhalation and your exhalation last exactly the same. Focus your mind. Be aware of your body. Again, if you're losing the posture a little bit, how can that posture become natural? How can it happen natural in you without you trying? Just be aware of that. Breathe into any part of your body that's tense, and use the exhalation to let go of that tension. Now let's open up to some gratitude. Gratitude; it's a very powerful emotion that also brings that signal of I am safe. If I am grateful it's because everything is flowing good. Life is good. Send that signal to your body, to your brain, and just observe how that brings even more presence. Where do you feel that gratitude in your body? Maybe in your chest, in your heart, in your belly. Where does it resonate for you when you tap into that emotion, just being more aware of how emotions flow in your body too? Even if you're not able to tap into gratitude right now, whatever emotion is flowing for you is perfect. Observe it; breathe it, and just see where is that coming from? Where is it vibrating? All emotions are in the body. Once you are aware of them, you help dissipate them, and you will allow them to come back to their pure state, which is energy. Not good or bad; it's just energy. Beautiful. Now we're going to hold the breath. This is going to help you go even deeper into rewiring your nervous system. Just very, very gentle, very simple. In your next exhalation, hold the breath as much as you can, and just count. Count where you're holding the breath. Allow your mind to be focused on the numbers. Your body is relaxed. Just allow yourself to be present on the counting and whatever you're feeling when you're not inhaling. Just stay in that place of nothingness, in that place of exhalation, that place of release. And whenever it's enough, take a sweet, gentle breath in; hold the breath, and just be present on that. What happens? What do you feel different right now? What's happening in your body? What are you aware of? I am presence. Repeat in your mind, "I am presence. I am presence. I am presence." Record that in every cell of your being. And when it's enough, just exhale very sweetly through your mouth. And again, take a deep inhalation; hold the inhalation. No exhalation, and repeat, "I am presence. I am presence. I am presence." And allow yourself to be floating in space right now. It's all aligned. It's all in flow. It's all in synchronicity right now. You are fully open and receptive to the energy available to you. Exhale whenever it's enough. Release with a sound, relax. Allow your body to relax. Beautiful. And just observe what's going on. Just observe. How's your mind right now? How's your body? What are you feeling? What are you aware of? Beautiful. Very gently, coming back. Whenever you're ready, opening your eyes. Well done. Welcome back. So now I invite you to just write about everything we talked about. What do you feel your main distractions are? What do you feel that's holding you back? It can be beliefs; it can be distractions as we talked about, social media, sugar; whatever it is, it doesn't matter. It's just observing, what are those distractions in your life? Not even wanting to change them, just observing and being aware that this is holding you back. I invite you to think about the identity of the no presence. What is behind the fear, the stress, the need to control, getting used to being in a certain way, being overwhelmed, frustrated, whatever that is? No judgment again, but ask yourself, "Where is this coming from?" Just be open and receptive to start seeing what is the core of this. We're going to go way deeper, but this is the beginning for you to just start observing and questioning, questioning everything. "Does it have to be this way? Do I have to behave in this way? Is this the highest for me?" It's a very beautiful journey, guys. So please let us know how it's going on your journey. And again, I invite you to join the community and share. We'd love to hear from you. We'd love to support you. We'd love to see that at the end, we're all so similar; we're human, living this beautiful, beautiful energetic experience on this planet, so why not share it together? Thank you all so much, and we'll see you very soon.

LESSON 2: Meditation - I Am Presence

So just observing that, I invite you to close your eyes. Please breathe through your nose. The nose. It's another signal. If you can breathe through your nose, your body takes that as, oh, okay, I can relax. I am open and receptive. This feels good. It's actually getting all the way into your parasympathetic nervous system, which is relax and digest and just be present and aware. So take your time, come into that breath counting that your inhalation and your exhalation last exactly 

The same. Focus your mind. Be 

Aware of your body again. If you're losing the posture a little bit, how can that posture become natural? How can it happen natural in you without you trying? Just be aware of that. Breathe into any part of your body that tense, and use the exhalation to let go of that 

Tension. Now let's open up to some gratitude. 

Gratitude. It's a very powerful emotion that also brings that signal of, I am safe. If I am grateful is because everything is flowing, good life is good. Send that signal to your body, to your brain and just observe how that brings even more presence. Where do you feel that gratitude in your body? Maybe in your 

Chest, in your heart, in your belly? Where does it resonate for you 

When you tap into that emotion, just being more aware of how emotions flow in your body too. Even if you're not able to tap into gratitude right now, whatever emotion is flowing for you is perfect. Observe it, breathe it, and just see where is that coming from? Where is vibrating? All emotions 

Are in the body. Once you're aware of them, you help dissipate them 

And you will allow them to come back to their pure state, which is energy, 

Not good or bad, it's just energy. Beautiful. Now we're gonna hold the, this is gonna 

Help you go even deeper into rewiring. Your nervous system is very, very gentle, very simple. In your next exhalation, 

Hold the breath as much as you can 

And just count. Count where you're holding the breath. Allow your mind to be focused on the 

Numbers. Your body is relaxed. Just allow yourself to be present on the counting and whatever you're feeling. When you're not inhaling, just stay in that place of nothingness, in that place of exhalation, that place of release. And whenever it's enough, take a sweet, gentle breath in. Hold the breath and just be present on that. What happens? What do you feel different right now? What's happening in your body? What are you aware of? I am presence. Repeat in your mind. I 

Am presence. I am presence. I am presence. Record that in every cell of your being. And when it's enough, just exhale very sweetly through your mouth. Ah, 

And again, take a deep inhalation. Hold the inhalation. 

No exhalation and repeat. I am 

Presence. I am presence. I am presence. And allow 

Yourself to be floating in space right now. It's all aligned. It's all in flow. It's all in synchronicity. Right now. You are fully open and receptive to the energy available to you. Excel whenever it's enough. Ah, release with a sound. Relax. Allow your body to relax. Beautiful. 

And just observe what's going on. Just observe. How's your mind right now? How's your body? What are you feeling? What are you aware of? Beautiful. Very gently coming back. Whenever you're ready, opening your eyes.

====================

LESSON 3: Rewire Your Presence Mindset
--------------------
<v ->Hey there.</v> Welcome to lesson number three. Today we are going to go deeper into the mindset of Ultra Presence and how to apply that into our lives through our bodies. All this Quest is based on a methodology I've been working for over 20 years which is called Quantum Flow. And it's all about how to live in the flow state. The flow state happens when you are present. So Quantum Flow is fully focused on that presence, on that flow state where your creative self is in full expansion, your abundant self is in full expansion. Today we're going to see the three pillars of Quantum Flow, which are all based on mindset, but then we bring that mindset to our core. We call it core-set. Setting the core for presence, for success. And then the other one is the heart-set. Setting the heart for that presence where we are in full expansion, in full radiancy. Once we understand these three pillars and how they relate with each other, we are going to see how this is going to be taken to every area of your life. How to take your business to the next level. How to take your relationships to the next level. How to tap into different layers of your purpose. Every area of life is going to be enhanced and amplified through presence. So let's start with the mindset of presence. What does it mean to be present in my life? This is all about the beliefs around what is it for you to be present in your life? Start with yourself. What is it for you to be present in your body? How do you nurture your body? What exercises you do? How do you cultivate the energy in your body? Everything is important, even how you treat your body. How do you talk to your body? What do you think when you look yourself in the mirror nude, and all these judgment comes of, oh, maybe there's excess weight or wrinkles or dark circle under the eyes. Doesn't matter what it is; how are you with your body? And is that in your highest? Because this presence is going to be reflected in your relationships. Of course, how you treat yourself is how you're going to treat others sooner or later. The truth comes up into the surface, right? So let's start by ourselves. And if we are not treating our body in the highest, just again, take a step back, observe, and ask yourself, "What's going on? Why am I feeding this to my body if I know this doesn't feel good for me? I know I get nervous or anxious, or I get frustrated or angry, or I lose energy. Why am I doing this to myself, to my body right now?" And let's stop it. Let's look at it, and let's journal around it. I choose to treat my body with love. I choose to eat the best food to nurture every cell of my being. I choose to do five minutes exercise every day. I choose to expand the energy in my body because this is my natural state. All the affirmations, all the beliefs, the full mindset of what it means for you to be present in your body. I choose to be in the best posture I can be. Breathe deep, and open up to my breath. Everything is important. Be clear because what for me means presence, maybe for you it's not that important. It's important to see where you are not being present with your body, and then create that mindset that you know you are committing to. And it's something that you can go back to all the time until it becomes your natural state. Why? Not because it just stays on mindset, but because we're going to bring it to the body. Mindset is just the beginning, but then we're going to go deep. So you can embody that, and it becomes something natural that you're not forcing. But it's very important to have that clarity. Without focus and clarity, you're going to be just going all over the place to whatever life gives you and just trying to survive instead of thrive. Now, let's look at the mind. "What is my relationship with the mind? Now that I see that the thoughts are all over the place and there are all these negative thoughts that are actually bringing me down and they're not supporting my soul's mission, my soul's purpose, what am I going to do about it?" Well, let's start getting clear on "I am a positive machine creator of thoughts, right? Like I align to the highest vibrational thoughts available to me right now. My mind is focused, crisp, and clear. I align my conscious mind with the supraconscious mind." That is the infinite mind. God, infinite energy, that energy that's available to you. Are you aligning your thoughts with that energy, or are your thoughts just in the ego that is separated and running its own programs? This is definitely a mindset. Once you are clear on that, and it's like, may the thoughts that come through me are of the highest and are coming from this universal source, energy, and are flowing through me, you are going to be connecting to thoughts that are going to amaze you actually because those thoughts are not yours. They're flowing through you. And sometimes if you are aligned to the thoughts of the collective or you are aligned to thoughts of the past that are being repeated through you, then you keep going in those loops. But if you have the mindset of like, "My mind is a computer, is a crystal, is a channel of the universal thoughts," you start aligning to that. It's definitely a choice. And knowing that all the work you're doing is to allow that to be in your life. So what is the mindset with emotions? "Am I just getting lost in the emotions that come and go? Or am I aligning to transform any emotion that is in a low vibration into an emotion of creation? I choose to feel every emotion that's vibrating in my body. I feel it. And from that feeling, I enhance it. I take it higher to the next level. I use it for creation. So again, it's not running away from emotions. Many people just numb their emotions. That's not presence. They're not being present in their body. We're running away from these emotions that aren't comfortable. "So I choose to feel every emotion that's flowing in my body right now, and I choose to transform it. I am an alchemist. I am capable to transform any emotion of low vibration into a high vibration emotion. This is my natural state." And again, you do this with every belief, with every pattern that's related to emotions that you know it's not your highest. It's not bringing you to full presence. You start with that mindset of what your ideal life is. What is your natural state? What are you opening up to? In the same, we would say with that spiritual connection, that connection with your soul, that connection with the energy that's available to you. "I am open and receptive to this creative energy all the time. I allow myself to stop and surrender to this energy flowing through me. I allow myself to listen and to trust in this infinite energy that's guiding me. I open my intuition so I can perceive, so I can listen to the messages coming through me when I am present." All these beliefs, all these mindsets, you start creating your own personality, your own lifestyle, your own way of living. Yes, it takes commitment; it takes time; it takes presence. But once you start building it up, I promise you, you're going to start taking it into the core of your being. And that's why I want to share with you Quantum Flow. Quantum Flow. It's all about taking this mindset and then feeling it, embodying it. 'Cause you can say, you can write for hours, but then you go out, and you have a challenge, and then you're all over the place. You're lost. And it's like you even forget what the mindset you committed to was. But once you build it in your body, then you will see that you will be living in a very different way. So once you're very clear on the mindset of what is Ultra Presence for you, we're going to take this into the core. We're going to do, first, an activation that's going to help you release what we talked about before, that cellular memory that's holding you back, that microtrauma that's not letting the energy flow in your body. All that's blocking you from being your highest self. We're going to open the pathways to that, the neural pathways. We're working here with neuroscience, neuroplasticity, quantum physics, everything. The most advanced technologies applied to the body. That is what Quantum Flow is. We use the most advanced technologies in science, and at the same time, we use the most ancestral wisdom that has helped millions of people upgrade their life. And when you mix both of those, you really biohack the nervous system, and you really start seeing how this mindset starts being embodied with ease, grace, and flow. So Quantum Flow works with the core. And it's not only the core here, which we know the core as the muscles. Yes, the muscles are important. We're talking about the pelvic floor; we're talking about the naval towards the spine. And I will explain this in the practice, just letting you know and preparing you. We are creating that ball of fire that in martial arts, for example, you call the hara. It's the center of power. But what happens, this hara is not isolated. This core is connected to every muscle of your body. Nobody taught us this. So your body has a disconnection between all the parts. There's a separation. Presence is coming back to union. It's coming back to oneness. And it's not only the oneness of like, "Oh yeah, I'm spirit. I'm one. I'm one with God and one with every human being." That's beautiful. But let's bring that to your body. Let's let your body know that oneness, coherency, synchronicity is flowing at a cellular level. And this is why we connect the muscles, reconnect the muscles to your core. Your muscles are the ones that send the signal for your body to feel safe. Once you really learn to activate your muscles and you create that reconnection, which you will feel it. You will feel it in your brain. You will feel it in your body. It's actually something that you can testify for yourself. Once that process is happening, what's going on is like you're sending those signals of like, "Oh, we can bring the guard down. We don't have to be in flight-or-fight response all the time. Oh, okay, I can be calm and receptive." By activation, by what we call the stress response. You're working with the stress response to bring a little bit, just enough, stress in your body, in your nervous system in order to calm your nervous system down more and more. And that's what's building the resiliency we're talking about. This resiliency comes from the nervous system that's completely connected to the muscles, that's connected to your organs, that's connected to your brain. The nervous system is everything. It's your remote control. So what we're doing with Quantum Flow is that we're going to go into the core; we're going to release; then we're going to start building the energy of the core, reconnecting it with the muscles. You're going to feel the presence in your body, in your eyes, in your life. And then we're going to take it into what we call the heart-set which is that space of compassion, of love, of abundance. When you learn to live in your heart, you live in bliss. You teach yourself how to always come back to that place of bliss, of gamma brain waves. That is the place of flow state. That is the place of full presence. That is the place of manifestation. Okay. Beautiful. So now that you understand the science, let's put it into practice. First of all, let's see what is your Ultra Presence mindset? Get very clear on that. Even if it's just three lines on each one of the areas I talked about, it's okay. Just get focused; get clear. Start getting that message to your mind, to your brain, to your nervous system. Then after you're clear, we're going to follow today's Quantum Flow for you to go and feel that process now through your body, and feel what it means to be present in your body and your life. Now, this presence that you bring into your life, you are going to naturally see it manifested in your relationships, in everything you do, in your business. Everything is going to be influenced by that. We're going to go deeper into that theme. But for now, just be observer of the show. What happens when you do these activations? And how are you showing up differently in your life? So let's enjoy this journey together. Comment in the group, whatever you're going through, and always be grateful for whatever's opening to you right now. Thank you for being so present in this lesson. We'll see you in lesson four, on how to biohack your life into Ultra Presence. I will be sharing with you some biohacks. So I invite you to come into this Quantum Flow journey with an open mind and ready to just enjoy the process. And of course, in our next lesson, we're going to go deeper in biohacks to Ultra Presence. Thank you all so much for being here, for gifting this to yourself. We'll see you very soon.

LESSON 3: Quantum Flow - Embodying Ultra Presence

- Hola; hola, familia. Welcome to your first Quantum Flow activation. Thank you for being here and for opening up to the embodiment of Ultra Presence. So we are going to be building this practice step by step. We're going to start with warmups, and slowly we're going to start opening up, until we get to a most intense practice, in the middle of the journey. You're going to have all the different colors of the rainbow, so you can always explore and feel which is the one that suits you best. But at the same time, I recommend you to go and practice each one of them because you're working deeply on different parts of the nervous system. So, let's get onto this. I invite you to come to a standing position, feet parallel, hip-width apart, more or less. Let's bring awareness to our breath. I invite you to bring your hands to your belly and take a deep breath where you expand your lungs all the way down, and that expands your belly. Sometimes, this is a little more difficult to feel, but you'll get it with the practice. When you exhale, you relax. When you inhale, you expand. This is letting your nervous system know to calm down, to relax. You can relax your arms. Keep breathing soft and gentle. And now be aware of your posture. Maybe close your eyes, so you really feel your posture, and allow your shoulders to go up when you inhale and back, so your heart is open. You are relaxed. You're present, fully present in your body, and there is like a little golden string that is pulling you up, stretching your spine. That is presence to opening up space in your body. Relax your arms; relax your jaw, your neck. And from this space, connect with your intention. So you can bring your hands to your chest, to your heart if that feels good. Why are you here? Why are you calling into your life? What are you calling into your life? What is your intention? I am presence; I am grounded. I am alive and awake. I am upgrading every area of my life. Take your time to tune in yourself; whatever feels good for you. And bring some emotion into that intention. Bring some gratitude. Letting your body know that it's already done. You're already in the journey. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Whenever you're ready, take in a deep inhalation; expand your arms all the way up. Stretch your body. Find that openness in your body; open your eyes. Stretch all the way up to your fingertips. And then exhaling, just relax your arms to the sides. Bend your knees; ground all the way down into the earth, so tuck in your tailbone a little bit. You can go to your back and touch a little bit the tailbone, the sacrum, and just bring it down a little bit. Yes, tuck it in just enough. This is going to activate your core. That brings more presence into your life, into your body. Your knees are microbended, so your legs are awakened, and they are fully present. Hmm, beautiful. Now from this space, bring your hands on top of your thighs. Take a deep breath, shoulders back; bring your head up, and then exhale through your mouth very gently, all the way down. Relax your head; relax your neck; allow your head to hang. Then inhale vertebrae by vertebrae. So our first mission here is opening the spine. Enjoy that sweet, gentle breath. Activating that cerebral spinal fluid for energy to move. It's good to exhale through the mouth; that's a big release. Inhale through the nose, always inhaling through the nose. Let's do one more. It's warming up the body. Inhale, open up. Arms up, expand. Hold the breath. And then exhale, relax. And just feel more aware, more present in your body. Your arms naturally relax down. You're coming to a beautiful present state, gently relaxing it down. Nice, now, let's open the spine a little more. So from side to side, remember to deep, remember to breathe deep. Just opening, moving that spinal fluid. Keep breathing, and incorporate your head. You want to get all the way up into the cervicals, and the hands are completely loose. So the hands are massaging the organs, the liver, the stomach, the kidneys on the back, waking up the energy of your core, releasing, relaxing, and moving the energy through your spine. Nice and gently coming back very sweetly. Allow your body to come back to center. Inhale, bend your elbows. Bring all this energy to your chest, to your heart. Hold it right there. And then exhale, relax. Allow your body to sink all the way down to the earth. Nice, and just feel the difference. Very gently, we're going through all the joints. So, let's start with the wrists, just opening up. The joints are doorways to energy, doorways to electricity. So, one way, then the other, simple, simple warm up. Then going to the elbows. Keep breathing. You're oxygenating all the joints, bringing energy one way then the other. Nice, then the shoulders, back and down. Inhale. And relax. You inhale. And relax. Allow your whole body to relax. So we're moving all the tensions of the neck, which is very important, to bring energy to your brain. One more. Come back. Hold it. And exhale. And just feel how energy's moving gently. Now, the head from one side to the other, is like half moon. Finding that stretch in the sides of the neck, in the back of the neck, really opening up. Remember to keep breathing. Remember your intention. Beautiful, coming back to center. Mm. Hands on the hips. Now let's open the hips very gentle, opening it up. Deep breath. One way, then the other way. Letting your body know you are in flow. Nice, let's go to the knees. Uh-huh, one way. All circles; joints love to move in circles, just like that. Yeah, come back to center, and let's get a little bit of activation on the ankles. So this one, you raise the ankles, and you let them fall down. And this is going to activate now your nervous system, flowing the energy all the way up to the back of your brain. So, breathe. Feel how that relaxes, even, your shoulders, your neck; energy's moving; that's it. If you have problems with the knees or the ankles, do it very gently. This is not about quantity, it's more quality and about you relaxing into it. Three more. One more. Just feel. Just observe. Microbend your knees. Inhale all the air into your body. Hold it right there. Find a nice stretch. Hold the inhalation. Fill yourself with energy, with electricity and exhale. Receive. Allow your body to move how it wants to move. Always letting your body flow, nice. Okay, now let's open our feet, 45-degree angle. More or less, wherever you feel good. The knees go on top of the ankles, more or less, or even separate, but they don't go over the ankles. The knees go on top of the ankles, more or less. What you don't want is the knees beyond the ankles. You want to protect your knees. So just by being here, you're starting to feel it, right? Building the fire, the energy in your legs. When there's too many thoughts you want to bring it down to the earth. Your legs and the butt are the ones that have more blood. So once you bring blood down, that's grounding. And that's what we're doing right now. We want to ground; we want to be in the body. Ultra Presence is in the body. All right, starting to feel. Yeah, so let's get it moving. Inhale up and relax down. Bend your knees; relax your body. That's it. Inhale up, and down. That's it; get it flowing. Grounding like a mountain. The presence of a mountain, the power of a mountain. One more. And hold it right there. Inhale the arms up. Allow them to flow up, to float. Legs are activated. Hold it right there. Zip it in through your mouth. Your whole body expands. Stretch, inner smile, and then receive. Ah, and just feel. Just feel what's going on. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Yes. Nice, so gently coming back. Release the tension in your legs, right? It's good to build it up. Also, release it. Maybe shake 'em off a little bit. We're going to be doing a lot of shaking here because that's how you access the nervous system. So shaking your arms, your shoulders, finding a shaking that works for you. Maybe working with your knees. Releasing tension. That's it, one more. Good, and then coming back. Just feel.

- Nice, nice.

- Take a deep inhalation; hold it. And now with your hands, tap on the center of your chest. Wake up the nervous plexus of the heart. Right there. You're holding it, no exhalation. And now expand it. That's good. Inhale. And then exhale, go to the center and activate hands. One towards the other, elbows, one towards the other. Start opening up the nervous plexus of the core. You exhale, and it's like the air is dense. You're activating that fire within, and then you're inhaling, expanding. That's it. One more. And now inhale; expand. Hold it, and then exhale; receive. Again, allowing your body to flow. Yeah, ground into your feet; bend your knees. Yes, welcome the energy in your body. Welcome the presence in your body. Now we're going to take it a little higher just to wake up the energy. I want you to feel the energy. So this is connecting with your intention. And there we're going to move on the energy of celebration. You're waking up the energy in your body, connecting with what you're calling in this course, Ultra Presence, through every breath. Okay, so this one starts the same. It's like you're waking up the energy in your body. Just like this. Yeah, opening it up; that's it. And then if you can, start expanding. Ah, that's it. Wake it up; wake it up. Connect with your intention; wake it up. Full presence in every area of my life. Full energy, full electricity. Wake it up. Yes. Ah, let's get some energy moving, the heart pumping, the blood, circulating; that's it. Open your eyes big. And come back. Ah, and just feel. Feel the energy; that's good. Okay. Nice. oh, deep breath and let's close with a beautiful feeling your body, close your eyes, and just allow your body to move with the music. Celebrating now. Through your body. Allow your body to feel the music, feel your intentions, and just explore. Close your eyes. Dance as nobody's watching. Keep breathing. And feel into this. Keep breathing, yes. Celebrating your presence in the world. Celebrating your energy; celebrating your gifts. Celebrating who you are. Allow it to be; allow it to flow in full relaxation. It's not how I look; it's how I feel. How I feel when I dance, when I express myself. Even if it's simple. Let it move through you. And opening your eyes. Dancing here together in this beautiful beach in Costa Rica, in the jungle, celebrating life. You are here with me, rocking it together. Yes, say yes to Ultra Presence; that's it, familia. Ah, so good. And gently bringing it back. Yeah, that's it. Sweet breath. Sweet breath. Breathe it into your heart, gently, gracefully, and expand it. Inhaling it into your heart, and expanding it all around you. One more, full presence in your body. Nice, visualizing, feeling, or knowing you are expanding your energetic field, your field of magnetism, of manifestation, through Ultra Presence. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Bringing your hands, to your heart, just feeling into this practice, feeling into the gratitude of being alive and awake, present in your body. Thank you; thank you; thank you. I invite you now, if you want to meditate, sit down a little bit. If you want to lie down, please always listen to yourself. Always follow your own flow. Whenever you're ready, just opening your eyes. Thank you so much for this first journey together. Can't wait to go deeper with you. See you soon.

LESSON 4: The Best Biohacks to Be Ultra Present
--------------------
<v ->Hola; hola, familia.</v> So how's your presence today? I want to share with you some tips that have helped me and thousands of clients around the world to build up that presence in their life. So these biohacks I'm going to share with you are all based on stress response, and of course, you may ask yourself, "Why am I going to be inducing stress when I want to actually release stress so I can be fully present in my life?" Well, all of these are techniques that we actually use to give the right amount. If you've too of it, of course, it's going to be too much stress on the body, and it's actually going to tax your nervous system and your adrenal glands, but if you give it just enough, what you're doing is really activating that sympathetic nervous system in order to really work on the parasympathetic nervous system to calm it down and find that balance. Once you've found that balance of that action and that receiving, that feminine and masculine energy, that is Ultra Presence. If it's too much action, you're hustling; you're pushing; you're too much in your mind, in your rationality, trying hard to get somewhere, and you're not available to what's there for you in presence. And if you're too relaxed and just floating, you're not going to get accomplishing anything. So how can we balance that is through all these biohacks I am going to be sharing with you. So let's talk about temperature. Temperature is one of the most amazing stress responses you can have. So if you go, for example, on a cold shower, just enough to get your system into survival mode <v ->what's going on-and get all those hormones going</v> in your blood, <v ->and there's something going on here</v> that's not normal- if you do it for a minute, up to three minutes, that's going to be amazing for your system. You can build it up and of course, you can go into a cold plunge. I do a cold plunge every day, sometimes three times a day. But I've been building it up from seconds until my body is not stressed anymore when I go into the cold for many minutes. So building that cold in your body is really good, and then always breathing, always opening up, not staying stressed after the cold. How fast can you relax after you receive the stress response? Many people don't talk about this when they do these therapies, but it's as important as doing the cold, as important as relaxing and teaching your body to relax as fast as it can, as soon as you come out of the cold. Yes, and that's through breath; that's through being present; that's through really teaching your body to do that, so you build that resiliency. The same happens with the heat. Using a sauna is amazing. If you have it around you or you can go even once a month, just teaching your body to go into that space of letting go, of sweating, of releasing and then right after, when you come out, teaching your body to breathe, as we have done in the beginning of this course, that long, sweet, gentle breath in order to bring that stress response down, and your body starts building that strength from within. That strength is your presence. And again, you can start with minutes, one, two, three, five minutes; take it all the way up 20 minutes maybe. No more is recommended. But feel your body. What's important is while you are in the hot, stay as relaxed as possible. And when you come out, relax even more. This is what's important. Bringing that stress response, and then bringing it down. With Quantum Flow, as you saw yesterday, we're doing the same. We have a deep activation, and we bring relaxation. We have a very empowering breath, and then we have a very calming breath too. It's all about playing with that nervous system in all the ways possible, so you can really make it strong and resilient. With exercise, it's exactly the same. Some people go and work out for one hour, one hour and a half, and what they're doing is draining themselves, like doing all this aerobic exercise that your body is actually being taxed; it's too much for your body. So unless you are working on certain sports that require that, for just being healthy and being present in your body as much as you can, we don't recommend you spend so much time doing that. Work intelligently. And we have clients losing so much excess weight from their bodies naturally without diets because we're biohacking their metabolism. We are bringing the body back to its natural state. See the difference? Instead of forcing and pushing, when you work intelligently, you teach your body to come to its natural state. Another type of stress response is intermittent fasting. Not eating right when you wake up in the morning, taking some water. You can drink some coffee. A little bit of coffee, hopefully with some coconut oil, or you can try the recipe I'm going to be posting here in the group also. Whatever works for you. But really get your body going into that burning fat mode without putting any glucose, any sugar, in your body. That creates a certain stress response, but if you really listen how long to take it, and then how to ease it out through like very light food or juices or whatever diet works for you, what's important is pushing that limit of "I need to eat right in the morning" to "Oh, let me try what happens if I don't eat. Let me try what happens if my body kind of rests and detoxifies." And let go of all the chemicals and all the toxins we're carrying, and everything we had digesting from the night before. All that is in your body. So once you start teaching yourself to fast, you're starting to let go of all of that. And this always brings you into presence. You can see this in the training of animals. For example, if you watch dogs, how they train them, it's all related to food. It's not recommended never to feed your dog without the dog doing something that you're teaching them 'cause they get used to the food is always there. It's how the animal nature works. Well, we have an animal brain right here on the back, and we've been used to live from our animal brain. This animal brain gets stimulated when you're like okay, yes, I want to eat. What if I work out first? What if I write a little bit on my journal? What if I go for a walk? What if... Whatever works. Give yourself the food after almost as a stimulation, as a gift, as something you want. And it's beyond you; it's for your body. Your body starts understanding this, and then you'll find that when you are fasting, you are more clear in your mind. You have more energy; you are more focused; you're more centered; you're more present. Way more present than if you wake up and eat food. You're kind of like oh, give me some coffee so I can survive 'cause all my energy's in digestion, and your body's almost like hey, that's all I needed. Now I'm good. That's the attitude. So it's harder to get into that presence that you want in every area of your life. Another great tool that we have is really biohacking the pelvic floor activation. Really learning how to activate those muscles and refine them. We're going to be doing this a lot in Quantum Flow, but just so you know, this is very important because you're teaching your nervous system to have the electricity flowing, not stay in the first three nervous plexuses that are in your belly, like at the base of your spine, behind the naval and right on your solar plexus. You have nervous plexus that have accumulated all the stress in your life. Yes, those are related to the three energy centers that we call chakras that are the energy centers of survival. They are the energy centers of the physical body, and they are completely related to the nervous system. So what we're doing with the pelvic floor activation and that connection of the hara is you're pumping up that energy. You're opening up, and you're bringing that energy through the inductance field, which is the field of electricity around your spine, and you're teaching the body to bring all that energy up, so your body, instead of wasting all that energy always in survival, always to keep you safe, always to protect you, always like with a guard mode. It's like a body armor that you have. That is not letting you be fully present to what's available to you. You start opening that energy, releasing all those mechanisms of defense, flight-and-fight response, and you start bringing it up into the heart, which is love, which is abundance, which is energy, which is freedom up into the brain, which is full creativity, which is activating your pineal gland, your inner crystal for intuition, for receiving all those ideas you want to tap into. And again, for this, you don't need to do your Quantum Flow session somewhere where you have time and energy and nobody's watching. You can do this driving if you want. You learn how to activate your pelvic floor in such ways that wherever you're at, whoever you're at, you can be talking to people, and you can be activating; you can be moving. Some emotion comes through, and you use the pelvic floor to move that emotion through your spine. It's very interesting. Your body is your temple, and it's an amazing instrument of manifestation if you are present. And one last tool that I want to share with you is the connection with the Earth. The Earth emanates electromagnetic frequency that you can actually measure. It's called the Schumann frequency. This frequency enters when you touch your skin to the Earth. It can be your feet, your hands, your whole body. Whatever touches direct contact with the Earth is giving you that frequency that is actually the frequency of grounding, of earthing, of being present directly with your pelvic floor. Your pelvic floor is directly connected to the Earth. Your pelvic floor is just a reflection of that Earth chakra, that Earth center that's called Muladhara chakra actually, and it's your connection with the vibration of the Earth. So just going there and doing Quantum Flow barefoot on the ground, you're cultivating that presence. When you're too much in your head, thinking too much, go outside; bend your knees; do that posture of really connecting with Earth through your feet. And you'll be practicing this with Quantum Flow. And you'll see how this will completely shift your state through the presence of your body. So of course, the practice of Quantum Flow today, it's going to be all about the pelvic floor, that connection with grounding with the Earth and how to bring presence into your body. And of course, I invite you to just go over these biohacks and what can you apply on your life right now. Pick one. If you can, at least pick one, and work with that stress response. Start getting into that practice of really expanding your capacity to hold stress and to release it as fast as possible. This is going to build your resiliency. This is going to build your presence so fast that you'll see results in every area of your life. Amazing, familia, thank you so much for this beautiful, beautiful process together. Congratulations. You've just finished the first part. This is amazing. Keep going. Remember, let's go to the end, so you can really understand, even if I'm talking about stuff that you have already done, it's okay. Let it be. Know that we're going to go deeper and deeper, so you can complement whatever you're doing already. So now it's time to go into part number two where we will be rewiring the nervous system and going deeper into the science and art of that methodology. Thank you all so much, and see you very soon.

====================

LESSON 4: Quantum Flow - Connecting With the Earth
--------------------
<v ->Hola; hola, familia.</v> Welcome to your second Quantum Flow activation. Hope you're enjoying this. Remember, this is all about your own flow. Wherever you're at, if you have never done anything around exercise or breathing, take it easy. You can adapt. You can do it in your own way. What's important is that you find your own way to reset your nervous system. The most important is not following Juanpa perfectly. It's about you finding you. What feels good for you? Where is your release? Where is your stretch? Where is your breath? That is what Quantum Flow is. It invites you into your own flow. So for today, I want to invite you to start sitting down. Just find a comfortable position. And bring your feet to the floor. You can open them to the sides if that feels good. You can have them closed if that feels good. Always finding that comfortable position for you. What's important is that your spine is straight. It's like being pulled up from the sky. Yes, there's space in between each one of the vertebrae. At the same time, your shoulders are back. Find that connection with your body. Just relax your arms. Relax your body. Close your eyes. And again, coming to that sweet loving breath. Inhaling through your nose. And exhaling through your mouth, very gently. Allow the air to expand your lungs completely all the way down, expanding your belly. When you exhale, allow your body to relax. Just scanning if there's any tension in your body right now. How are your shoulders? How's your neck? How's your jaw? Breathe into any tension in your body with presence. And exhaling. Release the tension. From this place of pure presence in your body, observing your thoughts. How are your thoughts today? Welcome them. No fighting them. Don't try to change them. It's like looking at clouds that are passing by. Welcome. And observing your emotions. How are you feeling today? How are you doing? Loving yourself wherever you're at. Not trying to change anything. Just being aware. Thank you; thank you; thank you, emotions. Energy, emotion; thank you. And how's your energy? Are you aware of your energy today? Are you aware of the energy flowing through your body? And if not, it's all perfect. You will be aware. After a couple of lessons, it will open up for you more and more. Just takes some practice. And from this space of awareness, just connect with your intention. You can bring your hands to your heart if that feels good for you. Or just stay there completely relaxed and open to your intention. Today, I'm grounding deeper into my body. Today I'm opening up deeper layers of presence. I'm waking up the energy in my spine. I'm waking up the electricity through my nervous system. Opening up to deeper layers of awareness, of presence through my body. Whatever you want to add there to your intention. Tapping into the gratitude. Hmm. So it is. Nice. Whenever you're ready, opening your eyes. Inhale, open your arms up. Find a nice stretch there. Always open yourself to life. And then exhale; just relax. Relax your arms. Allow your body to move gently. Ah. Nice. Hands come top of the thighs. Take a deep breath. And again, finding that energy through your spine. Exhale forward. Inhale vertebra by vertebra. Exhale forward. Getting into that spinal flow, remembering your spine is like, the heart of your electric system. The core, the battery of your nervous system. The whole spine, just an extension of the brain. So wake up that brain through the spine, through the breath, through the movement. Three more. So we exhale through the mouth, releasing toxins, moving energy from your navel, from your belly, from the organs. And we are always inhaling through the nose. And very gently coming back. Take a deep inhalation. Stretch your arms. Hold it right there. No exhalation. Open your eyes. Be present in your body. Expand yourself. I am present. And then exhale; relax, ah. And allow your body to move if it wants to move. Just being present with whatever's going on for you right now. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. Very nice. So now that we got some energy moving in the spine, now we want to wake up the base of the spine. That is the pelvic floor. That is where the energy begins to ascend to your brain. So I'm going to share with you some ways to open up those energy gateways, Kundali energy, inductance field, however we want to call that energy that flows through your spine. Okay, so whenever you're ready, exhaling, bring your navel in, and activate all the muscles in your pelvic floor. Yeah, and you can use your fists. They connect directly to your pelvic floor. So when you inhale, you open your hands. And when you exhale, you squeeze. You squeeze. It's the anus, the pubococcygeus muscle, the perineum. All the muscles at the base of your spine in your pelvic floor, you're activating them. You're waking them up. And when you inhale, you're soft and gentle. Yes, take your own time and rhythm. So if you've never been in contact with these muscles, something you can practice is when you go to the bathroom, when you're going to pee, you stop the urine from coming out with those muscles, okay? That's your signal that you're using them. So keep going; keep breathing. Just letting you know some tips, so you can practice when you go to the bathroom and go deeper in your pelvic floor. Your pelvic floor is the base of your energy. So get it pumping, exhaling. Inhaling, you relax. Allow the energy to flow. Allow your heart to open. Remember, navel in and pelvic floor active. You're waking up the fire of your core. Let's do one more. And now stay. Activate your fists. Muscles are active. Feel all the activation in your belly, pelvic floor active, navel in. Your core is on fire right now. All the abdominal muscles are on fire. They're reconnecting with your pelvic floor. That's good; wake it up. And whenever you're ready, inhale and open up. Stretch. Hold it and expand. No exhalation, expand. Relax your neck; relax your shoulders; relax your jaw, and then exhale, and just receive. Allow the energy to flow through you. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. Just feel into that. Yeah, yeah. Now, interlace the fingers. Let's go deeper. Yeah, so inhale. And exhale, hands one on top of other. Squeezing. And stretch your arms just enough, and feel that activation on the base of your spine. Pelvic floor. Inhale very gently. Lovely and gentle inhalation. Exhale; activate. Fire it up. Remember that sound helps you activate your core even more. Waking up the energy in your body one more. Stay there. No inhalation. Stay there in the exhalation. That's it. Muscles are active, but relax your jaw; relax your neck. There's no need to bring tension to your upper body. And then inhale; expand. Stretch; open up. Open your chest; expand. Yes, open to the heavens, open to your intention. And then exhale, ah. And just feel. Feel the presence in your body. I am alive and awake. Thank you; thank you; thank you. I am Ultra Presence in every area of my life. Beautiful. That's nice, familia. Well done. So now that we started to activate the pelvic floor, let's bring more energy into the spine. Just to do a little closing, and open that energy in our bodies. Take a deep inhalation, shoulders back. Exhale forward, vertebra by vertebrae. Inhale, up. Exhale, forward. Allow your head to hang. Allow your head to hang. Allow your neck to stretch. Let's do three more deep breaths. Move the energy in your body. Come back to center. Take a deep inhalation. Again, expand your arms; expand your body. I am Ultra Presence. Bring it to every cell of your being. Hold that inhalation right there. Open yourself. Relax your shoulders, your neck, your jaw. Exhale; receive, and just feel. Observe. Tap into the gratitude of being alive and awake. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. Now see yourself in your daily life, bringing this presence, being more inspired, more awakened, more focused, more creative. That is Ultra Presence. Yes, and so it is. Ah. Bringing your hands to your heart with so much gratitude for this practice, for this activation. Hmm. Very gently coming back, opening your eyes. Beautiful, familia, we did it. Second activation. We're slowly building it up. I invite you to take it step by step with patience, with perseverance; we are rewiring your whole nervous system. It takes some time. I will guide you the whole way. Please stay with me. Trust. Even if you are not that deep into the work, and you have never done this before, don't worry; you will get it. Your body knows. That intelligence of the body is within you, and we're tapping into it. Hmm. Thank you so much for being here. We'll see you in the next lesson.

Part 2 - Rewire Your Nervous System

====================

LESSON 5: Understand the Magic of the Nervous System
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, familia.</v> You are amazing. Congratulations. Part number two. We are going to go deeper into the nervous system in understanding how it relates to presence and how it relates to your upgrades in every area of life. So, we're going to talk a little bit about those wires, those inner wires which are the neurocircuitries of your nervous system. We fire and wire them together every time we keep thinking the same thoughts, we keep feeling the same emotions we keep acting in the same way, reacting in the same way. Then that becomes our personality. What are we going to do here? We're going to understand it all fully into the science and then how can we bring that into our daily life? So, let's go a little deeper on the nervous system. For the electricity to flow in its optimal performance, we need to have a balance, as we said of masculine-feminine energy, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. It's like plus and negative on a magnet, right? Like the balance between them is what creates the optimal energy. The same is with the nervous system. So, usually 95% of humanity lives in a fully expanded, fiery, over-the-top sympathetic nervous system. It's all about action. It's all about thought, rationality, creation, making money, having goals, all this masculine energy that goes a little bit extreme. It's almost like we get lost in the outside world, and we relate that success. It's all about what's happening in the outside, forgetting what is really happening in the inside. So, why do you want all the money in the world if you are not feeling peace, if you are not feeling love, if you're not surrounded by the most amazing people and you're not living your purpose? What is all that money for, right? That can be an extreme of someone trying to get somewhere, accomplish something, which they thought in their mind was going to give them what they were looking for, but they weren't really looking for material things. They were looking for wholeness, which is the wholeness that comes from the soul, the wholeness that comes from your connection with your highest self. That we can say is the biggest purpose or the most important purpose that we have in this earth. It's not even about what we're doing. It's about how tapped in are we to our spirit, to our soul, to the energy, the electricity flowing through us. When we start working on the nervous system and activating it, relaxing it, and resetting it, rewiring it back to its natural state, we come to a place where of course action is important. Of course, everything I do is important, but I don't rely on that. My happiness doesn't rely on that. There's something deeper. That is the happiness, the bliss that comes from being, I am. I am already perfect. I am already connected. I am already whole. It's in my soul; it's in my spirit. It's in my soul blueprint. It is my natural state. Of course, you will not feel this if you are fully going a hundred percent and your nervous system for example can hold 110 volts and you're giving it 220. What's going to happen? You're going to collapse. You're going to burn out. You're going to be too much in what we call the beta brainwave, which is of course, it's the wave where you're focusing when you are reading, you're doing things, you're thinking; that's great. I love that brainwave, but it's not sustainable to live your life from there. In that brainwave, you are not attracting all that creativity that can flow through you. You're only acting from a place of what you know, what you've read, what you think is true, and you're not opening to all the ideas of a genius, a genius that you are, that will only come once you have calmed down the nervous system, balanced that electricity, balanced sympathetic and parasympathetic, and be in a place of openness, of surrender, of meditation, of alpha brainwaves, which is really a moment of presence, fully present to go beyond your personality, beyond this body, beyond the 3D, open up to different dimensions, more subtle dimensions that are only accessible when you have balance in your nervous system. So, every time we keep thinking, feeling, and acting in the same way, we start creating these neurocircuitries that are solidified. They're used to always have the same reaction in life. So, what happens is we just repeat these patterns and we say, "Oh, that's just the way I am." Okay, that's how I have created my nervous system in my life, my personality. That's not who I am. I am a soul. I am a soul fully connected, fully tapped in, living in abundance, in love, in energy, in confidence, fully connected to my purpose. That is the natural state of my soul. When I go out of it, of course all these structures start building around it. So, that's why I can't see it. It's like having clouds around the sun. I can't see the sun, but the sun is always there. Now, knowing this, all we are doing is releasing those clouds that are almost an illusion to the sun to be revealed in a place where you are flowing in life; you are in full action, but you are connected to your intuition. You are connected to every step. Where to go, what to do, when it's time to just stop and breathe, call someone, read a book, do a specific training. Anything that is aligned to your highest purpose, to your highest self, will be revealed. You will feel it. You will feel it in your gut because you are in that space of balance masculine-feminine. The feminine is the receptivity, is the surrender. It's the listening. It's being available to what comes next, and then the masculine acts but acts from that place of presence. When we keep acting from these old patterns of suffering, of limitation, all these beliefs that are holding us back; when we keep living our lives from all these limitations, all these old patterns, suffering patterns, limiting beliefs; when we keep living our lives from there, we are just living out of presence. It's the no-presence reality, because you're just repeating your past. How amazing is that? You're just acting from the body memory of the wounds, of the traumas, or whatever from the past and you're not fully available to the present. This is why this is so important and why presence comes from present or vice versa. Present comes from being present in our life, it's from the presence that we actually embody in our lives that we receive the presence, the gifts that life has available to us. Let me just share with you a small story of one of the manifestations that for me was so important. I was always looking for family. I was always wanting to manifest the love of my dreams, and I had it very clear how it was. I had it very clear what type of relationship I wanted. Even though I had the mindset superclear, I was doing law of attraction and positive thinking and everything that you can imagine. I wasn't rewiring my nervous system. My nervous system was in survival mode, very hurt, thinking that my partners when I went intimate, they were looking to, not wanting me to shine, not wanting to support me, not wanting to really be there for me, but this was my own story. Many times, this wasn't happening, so we created the dramas together. Of course I had my story; they had their story, and I always repeated the same story. For example, every time we had something intimate, a deep connection, my heart was opening, I was feeling vulnerable, more open than ever. Minutes after or sometime after, some drama would come out, a thought would be revealed of something that is not going well. I would express it, and that would create a drama because of the place it was coming from. It was coming from a wound of me trying to protect myself because I would feel myself very vulnerable. So, that would open up to a drama that would take all that intimacy and all that love and all that connection out of presence. I wasn't connected to love or my full potential anymore, and I kept repeating this over and over, until I said, "Stop. I need to be alone. I am going to rewire this. I need some time, some space. I just need to feel JuanPa. Look at those wounds; heal them, and feel when I'm ready to come back to intimacy because it's obvious I'm repeating the same story." So, I went very deep in all these methodology I'm sharing with you. Started seeing the shifts, started seeing the not good enough, the part that didn't want to be loved, the part that was scared to open my heart and be vulnerable, the part that felt that I deserve the best family ever, the best partner ever, there for me in every way. I started letting go of that, and I started tapping into the vibration, the frequency of the love I wanted to attract, beyond how my partner was going to look, beyond her eyes, her hair, anything. It was more the vibration. And there it was. Around five years ago, actually in A-Fest, it's an event from my Mindvalley that I'm sure you know of. I was taken there to speak and teach, and it was amazing. The most amazing people go there. It's so beautiful and really amazing women of course that are there offering a lot of opportunities, especially if you're a speaker or a teacher, right? So, I had so many opportunities, and I could feel my whole system going into it. My sexual instinct, my attraction of my eyes, my attraction to certain vibrations that maybe I was calling in the same exact relationship I was already repeating all the time, so I had to look at that. I had to see myself, my temptation, my instinct, my animal wanting to do things and really feel into it if it was my highest, and it was always, deep inside there was a "No wait. Wait. Wait." Until the last day, at the last minute, at the after party, 2:00am in the morning, on the beach where everything was finished. Only a third of the people were there. Ta-da, the goddess of my life appeared, and I felt it. She was walking. We saw each other in the eyes; no words, just looking at each other, recognizing each other. We got lost for five hours; no words. I didn't know her name. I didn't know where she was from. Nothing. It was pure love frequency, beyond love at first sight. It was just a soul-to-soul connection. Of course, this happened because I listened, because I stopped, because I surrendered. I wasn't with someone else in a room or somewhere else. I was there present and ready to leave A-Fest without finding the love of my life. I was okay with that too, even though I had expectations, I had to let go of expectations. I had to let go of rationality. I had to let go of trying to prove myself or trying to fulfill a gap with sexuality or whatever way I was trying to fill that gap with, and there I was fully present, shining, eyes wide open, full of light. I was in heaven, completely present in my body, and of course she would feel this. And after that, it's been five years, and we have created together the relationship of our dreams because she was doing exactly the same work. She was exactly in the same vibration, and that's why Shiva-Shakti, the masculine-feminine, danced together because we both listened; we both were present. We both were in that space of receptivity and openness, allowing the universe to guide us. This is what it means to be in that place of balance, masculine-feminine inside of us. The electricity is just enough to light that light bulb just enough, the perfect light, the perfect shine, not too much fire that burns it. Not little fire that there's no passion and inspiration, just enough, the perfect balance. This is what we're doing here, guys. It's very deep work where you get to be open to all possibilities because you have found that balance in your nervous system, that balance in the left and right side of the brain, which reflect both parts of the nervous system. How amazing is that? Now, I want to share with you just a little exercise, so you start understanding where your nervous system is. There's many ways to measure it. There's many ways to see it. For example, if you can't stand in peace, just sitting down and being okay with just not doing nothing. If you can't sleep well, if you're always thinking of the next thing to do, the next goal to accomplish. If it's all about pushing hard, and you're drained, and you need coffee and sugar to keep going and keep having energy, all these are signs that there is an imbalance in the nervous system. If you're needing too much like sexual contact, for example, if you're needing things from the outside, buying things, or getting too much lost in the outside reality, it's all an imbalance of the nervous system. It's very interesting. There's no judgment. It's just good to observe that I am not connected to that inner balance we're talking about, just to observe, and that's what we're shifting right now, right? Now, I want to share with you just a little exercise that will help you see how is your nervous system, purely through your body, through your breath. This is called a test that we call Bolt, and it's your capacity to hold the oxygen in your body; how much you can assimilate the oxygen at a cellular level. The oxygen is directly connected to the nervous system. It's all related, and through this breath work that we're doing in all this journey, you'll get to balance the nervous system too. So, the test is very simple. You have to sit down without doing much, like you've been doing now, for 10 minutes at least, and then just you are going to take a deep breath, and then you're going to exhale all the air out and see how long you can hold that exhalation. Again after being calm for 10 minutes, you take a deep breath; you exhale very gently. You hold the exhalation; you can cover your nose, so you are not in that trap of breathing through your nose, and just hold it. When you have the first impulse to breathe, you're going to breathe very gently. When you come back, if you breathe like this, you pushed it too much. 'Cause some of us is like, "Oh, I'm doing great. I'm going to prove it to myself." This is just very, very surrendered, very calm, just to see where you're at. Okay, I'll do it to show you. So, you take a deep breath. You exhale all the air out. And you stay there. You cover your nose, and you stay there. No inhalation and let's see how long you last. When you need to come back, just take a sweet inhalation, and then exhale. And relax. Yes, so you can see more or less like in the video if you can see the the numbers here, or just use a watch, but somewhere to see how long you can last without forcing it. Normally it's 20 seconds in all human beings; that means your nervous system is not quite well; it needs some balance, and like your performance is not that well. The athletes and people that work more with breath and are more tapped into the stress response of the nervous system can last up to 45 seconds, one minute, but this is very different from an exercise just holding your breath. It's just seeing the first impulse you're going to have to breathe in. That's when you count. If it's 10 seconds, 20 seconds, whatever that is, just to give you a little note on, okay, there's work to do on your nervous system. I invite you to try this with no judgment. And then, through the work we're going to be doing with Quantum Flow, you're going to see how that's going to expand and you can hold 45 seconds like nothing, supereasy. After this exercise, I'll invite you to just journal a little bit about the nervous system. How do you see yourself, raw and real. How is your nervous system right now, and how open are you to upgrade it, so you can really live in presence in your life? It's a very beautiful journey to look at yourself so you can change and upgrade yourself. Also, any negative patterns that you can start seeing of your behaviors in relationships, in business, in any area of your life, it's good just to look at them and write them down. We're going to go deeper into this, but I invite you to just start going into that self-awareness, so you can open up to your next level. Okay, Amazing. Well done everyone. We did it. Now next lesson, we're going to go deeper into the biohacks of the nervous system, so you can start really opening up and seeing the change in how you breathe, in how you act in life, in how you think, everything is going to be embodied more and more in your life. Thank you so much for your presence and we'll see you very soon.

LESSON 6: The Top 3 Breathing Techniques to Biohack Your Nervous System
--------------------
<v ->Hello; hello everyone.</v> How are you all doing? So grateful to be going deeper and deeper into the journey of Ultra Presence, the journey of the nervous system. Today I want to share with you a little bit more about the biohacks, for me the three most important ones. How you can use the breath to biohack your nervous system. This can be very easy and simple; you don't have to complicate it. And of course when we do Quantum Flow, we go deeper 'cause we're more specific in each one of the neurocircuitries and the meridians, which the meridians are the channels of energy that flow through your body, is where we do acupuncture. Those points of acupuncture are connected directly to organs, are connected directly to the nervous system, and we can access them through the breath, through the movement. That's what we do with Quantum Flow. That's a little more complex, and I will guide you on that, but I want to give you three biohacks that you can apply every day, anywhere, almost anywhere. Now, from this place of high vibration we're in, I want to invite you to come and practice whenever you can. We're going to go deeper into Quantum Flow using these concepts with movement, with breath. Very interesting to start doing these practices, so you can feel it more and more. So, all of them are related in that they are based on holding the breath. It can be the inhalation or the exhalation. It's different. The inhalation, it's more activating the sympathetic nervous system. And the exhalation is more the parasympathetic nervous system. What we're going to do is play with both and explore with both, really finding what they create in our body and in our minds, in our lives. So, all these breathing techniques have been done for thousands of years. In yoga, in Qigong, in shamanism, tantra, Toltecs, Maya, like there's so many cultures and traditions that I've studied for so long, and they all relate in the same. They work with the breath, with different techniques. But really when you go to the end, that you find that it's all about holding the breath. When you hold the breath, what's going on is that your nervous system is feeling it's going to die. So, what is really happening when we hold the breath is that all the neurons connect between each other, through what we call the synapses. When we are not breathing in inhalation or exhalation, these synapses start shaking. They start moving. So that neurocircuitry that you have created, related to patterns, behaviors, habits, whatever that is, starts moving, starts shaking. And if you do it in the right way, with the right mindset, and everything we're doing with Quantum Flow, you are recreating that neurocircuitry. You're recreating yourself, and now the way you really want to live in life, with presence, in every area of your life. So, what goes on is that, when you are holding the inhalation, you are activating the sympathetic nervous system. You are rewiring the sympathetic nervous system, and it's like full energy coming through which that really brings energy to your nervous system and shakes it. And when you're holding the exhalation, it's like a lack of oxygen. But, since carbon dioxide is more available, that is what really carries the oxygen into the cells. So, this is not about take more oxygen in, so you can oxygenate the cells. You can breathe as deep as you want, be hyperventilated, hyperoxygenated and don't have enough oxygen in the cells. It's in your blood, but it's not entering the cells. We're talking about entering the cellular membrane, so you can feed the mitochondria, the battery of your cells. Your cells wake up, start the regeneration process, start creating what we call the biophotonic energy, which is always there created, but we are really living on 10% of it. Once we start waking up this energy, we start raising our electricity our capacity to let this light, this electricity, flow through our nervous system. And as you see, this is not related to the amount of it or forcing it too much or pushing it; actually that can disconnect you from the full presence in your body. Full presence is balance, harmony. So, in order to achieve that, there is a balance between that inhalation and that exhalation. Exercise number one, what you can do even here while you're listening to me, just breathing gently through your nose, inhaling and exhaling. Don't have to move. Don't have to do like deep breaths or fast breaths. It's almost, you can't even hear it. It's imperceptible. So, the parasympathetic nervous system is like, ah, feeling so good, so open, so relaxed, and at a certain moment, whenever you want, stop breathing. Exhale all the air out, and just stay there. You can keep listening to me; you can be watching TV or a movie or reading a book. It doesn't matter. Play with that, and the first time you want to inhale, just inhale very gently, no forcing, and then exhale all the air out. That's once. Then keep breathing regularly, doing whatever you're doing. It doesn't matter in your regular life, huh? Then again, whenever you're ready, when you feel like, okay, you're calm and fully relaxed, and you can hold it again, go the second time, and you take it a little more. So, whenever your body wants to breathe, don't breathe; hold it, I don't know, 10, 15 seconds more, just a little bit, just enough. And then breathe as gentle as you can. This doesn't work- Not through your mouth, not straight, 100% very gentle. Teach your body to have that flow, where the oxygen and the energy, we call it prana or qi, that is, that comes with the oxygen will penetrate at a cellular level, is way more efficient, way more sustainable, and you're really taking it in. So, the second time you do it, you take it a little longer, then come back, okay? Keep reading; keep doing what you're doing. The third time, hold it a little more, just a little more that almost your body shakes a little bit. You're getting to the nervous system. Okay, if I'm here and I'm not breathing, there's no air in my body, and then I can feel like a little tick; you're getting there. You're getting to the nervous system. That's it, enough, three times; take it easy; keep breathing through your nose, and keep going on your life. Then you're driving, do the same thing. Then you're even swimming. I play a lot in the pool. I'm swimming, and I just hold my breath and play with it. Do it like a game. The more you do it, the more you're going to balance your nervous system, especially the one we need to balance more, which is activate your parasympathetic nervous system more, so you can relax easier. So, you can be more open and receptive, right? That's the one you want to work on, because we know 95% of humanity live fully on fire. Full sympathetic nervous system activated. Then, exercise number two is holding the inhalation. I recommend at least three times. So, after you've done that exhalation, take it easy. Whenever you're ready, you can do it minutes after if you want, or take your time, but at some time in the day, do the holding the inhalation. Same thing. You inhale; you hold it. No pushing. The first impulse to exhale, exhale. The second one, take it a little more. The third one, take it a little more. See what happens, okay? You're balancing both. So, this you can do together; you can do separate. Really feel into your body and where you're at because we all have different nervous systems, different levels of stress. It's all different for everyone. You have to be present in order to feel what is the right amount for you. Make it again like a game. Know you're building that presence; you're building that energy; you're building that resiliency. That will be reflected every challenging time, every problem that comes. You're building the mindset of "I can solve anything. Everything has a solution. Everything has a solution." Even if you don't see in the moment, you're not seeing the solution of it, it will come, but it won't come when you're stressed and trying and pushing. It comes when you relax, and that relaxation happens faster and faster the more you make your nervous system malleable. And the third breath biohack you can do is the same, but you can do it walking or running-with movement. So again, you're walking natural, breathing very gently through your nose, inhaling, exhaling, all through your nose. Remember, you're calming yourself down, and at the same time when you're fully calm, you're going to bring that stress response of no breath. So, you're walking, going for a walk in nature, or wherever you can walk, and then all of a sudden whenever you want, you exhale all the air out and keep walking; keep moving. Let your body know you're moving, relaxed. You're not pushing; you're not stressed. There is some stress inside, but you're okay. Everything is good. You're safe. Then whenever you feel to breathe, take a breath; exhale. Whenever your breath comes back to normal, do it a second time. Hold it a little longer. Do it a third time. Hold it a little longer, until like you can feel it affects your walk a little bit the third time. This is going to expand, yes, your capacity to take oxygen, your capacity to respond through your nervous system, but it's even deeper because you're in movement, okay? You're moving your muscles; you're moving your energy. It's very different than just sitting down. So this you can practice walking wherever, and if you want to take it to the next level, same exercise, just running or moving faster. So the same, you're going; you exhale all the air out. It's not running fast. It's very gentle. You exhale all the air and stay there. No inhalation and keep running. Keep moving. Whenever you feel to breathe in, breathe in; exhale, and again, just come back to the natural breath. Don't do it again if, if you're like this; take it easy. Balance it out. Teach your body to come fast, after it's a little altered, and you're a little out of breath, right? Teach it to come back to regular, sweet, loving breath. I promise you this is going to change your life. Very simple. Third time, take it a little deeper, okay? So go for it. Take it a little more. It's going to be a little uncomfortable. It's okay. You're going to feel your limit, and then you're going to come; your breath is going to be moving faster. Yes, a little bit out of breath. Very gently bring it back. Observe what happens. Take your time. Again, after you do this three times, work with holding the inhalation, same as you did sitting down. This time you can just stop and hold the inhalation. When you hold the inhalation, you're not running; you're not walking. You're just standing or sitting, holding it. Again, you start very gentle, not, very sweet one first, second one, take it a little more, third one even a little more, and just observe. You can do this once a day. You will see the changes in your life, and if you want, you can play with it more. I sometimes do it many times a day, and it feels really good, especially when I can see that I'm stressing out, that I'm reacting, that I'm thinking negatively, that I'm stuck in like an emotion, or something got triggered, right? Especially with intimate relationships. Oh, something got triggered because of something they said or something they did or didn't do. Whatever the story is, instead of reacting, do the breath. Let your nervous system that it can calm down, before you talk, before you react, before you say something that then, you're not going to like that you said it. This way, you're teaching your nervous system to respond to situations with high-vibration solutions, instead of with reactions that come from animal instinct that can actually create more mess, more drama. Disconnect you more from your presence, which is living your life in the highest frequency possible, and in this high frequency, I thank you all so much for staying with me. I know it's a lot of information. Please always reach out to me in the group if you have any question. I've explained it the best I could. I'm superopen to explain it better, or anything you need from me, I'm here for you. I want you to get it and to like really embody it, so you can thrive in your life and start really living the best life ever. Thank you all again for saying yes to your presence, for saying yes to upgrading your life through your nervous system. Thank you so much for your participation in the group too. Can't wait to hear from you. Remember, any questions you have, anything you want to share, we are there for you. And, next lesson is all about the alchemy, using the nervous system and how to improve our energy from the core. Can't wait to share that with you. See you soon.

LESSON 6: Connect & Rewire the Nervous System
--------------------
<v ->Today we're going to work with the stress response,</v> activating your body, getting that connection, that activation, in all your muscles, and then releasing. And teaching your body how there can be stress, there can be challenging situations, but at the same time you're teaching your body to relax instantaneously. Everything we do here, guys, is to take to your daily life; always remember that. So, I invite you to find a comfortable standing position, feet more or less hip-width apart, parallel to each other. More or less so we can start getting that alignment from the feet all the way up to the spine, all the way up to the head. Bring your hands to your heart, however you want; it can be one on top of the other; it can be on the chest; whatever feels good for you. It's about connecting with your heart, the most important is your intention. Why are you here? Thank you for being here. Close your eyes, gently; take a deep breath; allow your energy to expand through the breath. "I am here, I am open and receptive to this practice. I am grateful; thank you; thank you; thank you." And again, what are you calling into your life today? What is your intention? And you can focus wherever you want. It can be "I am love." "I am energy." "I am inspiration." "I am abundance." Whatever medicine you want to bring into your practice today, welcome it. This practice is for you. It's your own Quantum Flow. And whenever you're ready, feeling your feet grounded in the Earth, feeling the balance between the left and the right foot. Feeling that connection with the Earth, connected to your heart. And then opening up, stretching up, take a deep inhalation; connect to the sky; connect to the heavens; connect to the sun, to the stars; open yourself to the light that you are. And just keep your arms open. And very gently bring your left arm towards the side of the leg; open that, right arm up. Take a deep inhalation right there. Hold it. And then exhale very gently; come back to center, very gently, and let's do the other side. Inhale all the way up; find that expansion, your left side. Hold it; hold that inhalation. And then exhale; come back to center. Very nice; now very gently bending your knees, arms forward, inhale; activate the legs, and exhale; activate the arms. Chest back. Open up. Inhale forward. Ground to the Earth, exhale. Inhale forward, as deep as you can. Exhale. Warming up your body, couple more. Last one. Beautiful, inhale as deep as you can. Open your arms. Open your heart; open your chest; expand all around you. And then exhale; relax. Vertebrae by vertebrae. Inhale, calm. Vertebrae by vertebrae, inhaling, open your arms. Open yourself to life; full presence, exhale down. Couple more; inhale, vertebrae by vertebrae. Open your wings; open yourself to your full potential. Exhale down. Always relax your neck, your head, when you go down. Always sweet inhalation, full opening connection from your heart to life. Exhale down. Inhale vertebrae by vertebrae; this time bend your elbows, shoulders back; open your chest; bend your knees; activate your muscles. Muscles are fully active; core is active; everything is active; exhale. Relax. Inhale. Activate. Exhale. Relax. Inhale. Hold it. Exhale. Remember, holding the breath is rewiring your nervous system; activate your muscles; get your nervous system alive and awake. Exhale; let it go; teach it to relax. Inhale. There's some tension; there's some contraction, activation; exhale. Let it go. Now bring the sound. Aah. Aah. Aah. Aah. Aah. Aah. One more. Aah. Inhale. And exhale down, arms back; bend your knees. Aah. Release. Inhale up. And exhale down. Aah. Release. Inhale up. And when you exhale through your mouth, release; let go. Aah. Relax your neck. Your head. Aah. Your shoulders. Aah. Aah. Three more. Aah. Aah. Aah. Inhale up. Hold it. Hold it right there; expand it. Inner smile; feel that expansion from within; exhale. Aah, and just receive; feel how your body moves,; feel your breath, gentle, sweet, inside of you. Aah, that's it guys. That's it. Finding that flow. Mmm, nice. Now from this place of flow, let's explore a little more. Open your feet, 45-degrees angles; bend your knees, and just find that movement of water. Relaxing and opening all your joints. Whatever flows for you, allow the movement to come from the foot, pushing the foot, then the leg, and then the core. Playing with all your body. Just finding that flow, that sweetness, that gentleness. Mmm. Now we're going to play by holding the breath a little bit; yes, everything we've seen till now. Deep inhalation. Exhale all the air out. No inhalation, and keep moving. No inhalation. And then inhale. And exhale. Again, deep inhalation. Exhale all the air out. No inhalation, stay there; move your body, no inhalation. And whenever you're ready, inhaling. And relaxing. Bringing some of that stress response to your body, let's do one more. Deep inhalation. Exhale. No inhalation, keep moving, in flow, no inhalation; just explore that movement. And then whenever your ready, inhale. And open your arms, and hold it. Now this time zip it in through your mouth. Hold it. And then exhale; receive. Aah. Allow the energy to sink in your body; bend your knees; receive the energy. I am Ultra Presence. Let's do a couple more; inhale; expand. Hold it; zip it in through your mouth. So you expand more the space in your ribs, more the space in your body; exhale; relax. Allow your body to move how it wants to move. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Aah. Yes it's okay if it's uncomfortable; it's part of rewiring your nervous system. Yes, one more, deep inhalation. Hold it; zip it in. Expand yourself, and then exhale. Aah. Bend your knees. There's a light shower, coming through your crown. All the way down to the throat, to the heart, to the core, all the way down to the pelvic floor, all the way down to the legs, to the feet. My whole body, is filled up with the light of the universe, of the stars, of the sun. Inhale, your arms up; thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you, and exhale, bringing all that energy very, very gentle, through your body, through that central channel. Hands very gently, sweet, loving, integrating energy. Through your body. And whenever you're ready, take a deep inhalation; bring all this energy to your heart. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. And exhale; expand it all around you. Aah. Expand your presence; expand that capacity to be present in your body. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Aah, bend your knees; feel that presence in your body, alive and awake. Thank you all so much, familia. Hope you're enjoying this practice. And we will see you very soon.

LESSON 7: Become the Alchemist of Your Life
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, familia.</v> Science of alchemy, here we go. Let's explore a little bit more. What is alchemy? How is it related to presence and at the same time to success? So, when we go deep into this concept, we understand that alchemy's all about transformation. We've heard of the alchemist that transforms lead to gold. Maybe a situation that is challenging, actually into an opportunity. Using everything that happens outside of us actually as a catapult to go to the next level, instead of getting stuck and feeling the world is against us. "God is not on my side." "People don't love me." "I'm not good enough." All these stories that can happen because our nervous system is still stuck in the past. Once we actually start transforming that and releasing all those blockages from the nervous system, we don't have those behaviors anymore. We're actually bringing that capacity of transformation to our daily life. Let me just remind you something. You are an alchemist. You've always been an alchemist. It's your birthright. It is who you are. In order to really embody this, it's through presence. It's bringing presence in every layer of your being. Once you are present, you catch the thought. You catch the emotion; you catch the reaction that could happen right in the moment. You rewire it, and you start teaching your body, your mind, your emotions, your energy to act in a different way, from your highest self and not from those parts of your ego that are actually bringing you down. So of course, the base of alchemy is actually science. Alchemists are scientists. They know what they're doing. They really understand matter and how to actually bring magic or subtle dimensions into matter in order to create transformation. That's exactly what we're doing. We're bringing all these concepts of quantum physics, neuroscience, neuroplasticity into your daily life, into the little things that create huge changes in your life. Again, this is explored through the nervous system, through your body, through your thought patterns, and your emotions. Let me just share with you a story of one of my clients I worked for around six months, and this person, his name is Mark, beautiful man, powerful, very successful, many businesses. You would see him outside, and it's like everybody, every man, wants to be like him. Confident, strong, powerful. Like his presence was incredible. You would never think he wasn't tapping into his presence because it was like miles away that you could feel him. You could see him, the way he talked and moved, and he had that. But he had done himself that way. He knew that that was the way to be successful. It was all about mindset. The thing is, inside of him he wasn't feeling that; he was insecure. He wasn't feeling that energy or that power. He had fears. He had all these things that, actually, he had under the pillow. He wasn't even allowing himself to feel them or tap into them. So what would happen? It was very hard for him to get intimate. It was very hard for him to like open his heart and be available with his family, with his partner, with his friends. He had a lot of friends. He went partying a lot and drank alcohol and numbed himself and opened up and had the best time when he was drinking. But when he wasn't, he was kind of grumpy, frustrated. Inside, it was like very perfectionist. Things had to be in a certain way, and that was great. He accomplished a lot. The thing is, he wasn't happy. He wasn't in peace, and this is why he came to look for me because no matter how much he would create, how many new businesses and more money he would have, he wouldn't be in that space where he would come back home and feel family, feel love, feel like he wanted to share with them. What was happening? He had created this body armor of protection. He had this with his father, with his grandfather. It happened in his family. It was almost getting lost in workaholic, in a way to try to numb your emotions through work. There's many ways to numb ourselves and not be present with what's really going on inside and with all the gifts we have inside. So, we just focus in something, whatever gives us results. Okay, it's efficient. This works. It gives me money. I'm successful. Let me go deeper into that, and all this I'll put to the side. The thing is, to a certain moment, you'll touch the roof there, and you will feel that emptiness. Nothing material can really bring you back to that natural state of peace, of freedom, of love, of just being okay with just lying down in a hammock, having some family time, playing with the children, being with the partner for hours, just looking at each other in the eyes, like whatever it is, it's considered actually boring. It makes no sense. I prefer to be working, but it's not that that's my personality. It's not that that's the way I am. It's just a way almost to run away from parts of myself I don't want to see. So, this happened to Mark, and every time he came home, he felt almost out of the family. He didn't feel accepted. They had their own connection. His wife had a beautiful connection with the children. They had fun. It was like a really nice environment that he came into, but he couldn't be part of of it. So, when he felt that resentment of being away, he felt like he was putting so much energy into what he was doing. He was giving them everything, sacrificing himself so much. But when he arrived home, he didn't feel loved. He didn't feel that they would come and give him love and share with him and treat him as he wanted to be treated. What was happening? There was this energy being emanated from his nervous system that said, don't get close. I am here in my mission. I am here in my thing. My nervous system is actually stressed. I am in survival mode. I am in reaction. So, if he would come and the children were shouting or playing or laughing towards, he's like, "Shut up." And he would like bring out his anger or his frustration, or like, "Can't you respect that, I've been working all day, and I come, and it's like this noise. Can you just respect me?" Right? And what would that create? Fear in the children. Fear in the wife. Separation. A big barrier. But then if he tried to come close to them, he couldn't. It was like a huge gap between them and him, and he just felt completely alone and separated. It didn't even make sense for him to keep a family life. He was almost just trying to surrender that his life wasn't with family, and he just had to dedicate himself to work. This is when he came to see me. We did the work. We rewired that. He started seeing parts of himself. The more he released his nervous system, you know some fears came up; some fears came up. He had to be raw and real with himself and accept where he was at. What does that inner world, that was there that nobody knew about, that inner world had to come out in order to be rewired. Because if not, we're just living on a mask. And he did the work. We went deep in every level, in every layer, all through Quantum Flow. What happened? He started opening; he started releasing. He started letting go of his phone and not thinking about work all the time. He started like really giving the time and energy to just be with his family, just be. No agenda; no expectation. Not wanting them to be different or act in a certain way, just to be. He was surrendering to the process, and so much started evolving. His wife started approaching in a certain way that he actually was craving. He was craving that intimacy. He was craving making love deeply. He was craving like really connecting with his children. He was craving so much very deep inside. He couldn't ask for it because he didn't even know that was his reality. So, once you start opening up all those clouds, right? And you start releasing all of that, you start seeing what it is. You start speaking from inside and start sharing being vulnerable and accepting that you are human. We all have that human side. Even though we want to be the perfect men, the perfect woman that holds, that does, that is successful, and all that, that's possible. But, we can't let go of that human side that's always going to be there. It's the beauty of actually being human. We're not here to be perfect, to do everything perfect. To have our life almost plastic. It's not real. It's not deep. What gives depth to your life is that presence of accepting every part of your being and knowing that when you accept it and you're present to it, it will dissolve. It will transform. You become the alchemist. You're not stuck anymore in these two worlds of separation. These two worlds of separation, just to bring it to the body. It's the first three chakras, which is survival, doing, creation, manifestation, all that, in a very dense way. But it's like this first three chakras, the vortexes of energy related to this nervous plexus here, right? And many people live there. They're not connected to their heart, they're not connected to love. There's a big gap, almost like earth, which is from here down, is separated from heaven, which is the heart up, and there is a big gap. That's why there are two worlds. There's no connection with love; there's no connection with real expression. Expression that comes from the heart, expression that is authentic and real and unique, your unique gifts, your authenticity that only you have. You are one and only. Nobody can be like you. The gifts that you have are unique, and that's the beauty. When you are present and you're seeing yourself and you're living your life from within, doing the alchemy, and seeing all those parts of you that are comparing yourself to others. Envying others, going in social media, what they have, what they did, how their life, and comparing yourself to them, not even knowing what the truth is. Because one thing is the face that people put out there, and another thing is what's really going on inside. So, if we are comparing ourselves with that, we are just getting lost. We're out of presence. Presence is being wherever you're at, working with what you have, with gratitude, transforming it, and taking it to the next level. What is this next level? Coming back to the intelligence of your body, the innate intelligence that makes your heart beat, that makes your blood flow, that makes you breathe without even thinking about it. Sleep, everything. It's created through this parasympathetic nervous system, which is divinely controlled. You can access it. You can of course upgrade it, but it's already happening. Life is flowing through you. So, once you're coming to this intelligence, once you're coming back to your natural state, you're coming back to what we call your natural blueprint. Yes, your anatomical blueprint. The full potential that's available to you through your body, your mind, your emotions, your energy, your spirit; all of it is here and now. It's waiting for you to release, to transform whatever is not letting you access it. It's always been there. It's always going to be there. The thing is, the questions is, are you present enough to access it? Are you committed enough to this Ultra Presence, to go deep and release whatever's holding you back? Understanding it, loving it with compassion, letting it go, and at the same time, allowing it to upgrade more and more, closer and closer to your blueprint. The full 100% gifts you came to embody in this earth. So, if you were born an avocado tree, right? Give the best avocados you can give. Those are your codes, your frequencies. Don't compare with the mandarin tree, with the peach tree, and the other trees. You are not that. Be the best version of yourself. That only happens with presence. If you look at nature, nature is fully present. It just is. There's not trying to be, the fruits are not giving because they want something back. That's just the way it is. It's nature. It flows. The human being, because we have an ego, we have a mind, we have all these parts that alter reality, because it's an illusion of what's really going on. It's what distorts what we have the capability to connect to, which is our natural state. All we're doing is that. We're releasing all these sparks in our brain, in our nervous system, that makes us unique as human. But also, if you don't know how to do it, it actually disconnects you from your full presence. Perfecto. So, now that we have a little bit more of clarity, of how this body is made and everything we have access to, now let's go deeper into Quantum Flow. Let's go into this methodology and really go into like the body memory, the cellular body memory, that body armor we all have carried. So we can let it go, so we can transform it and start really activating that inner passion, that fire, that energy, that electricity that comes from your core and lights you up. Lights your nervous system; lights the energy inside of you. We're going to go deeper into the breath, into movement. I invite you to just trust the process and surrender and no expectations. See what comes. Have clear what are you letting go of? It's important to start exploring even more. More behaviors of procrastination, of self-sabotage, of not having self-love, of distraction, whatever that is for you that you know is holding you back from being fully present in your body, in your life. Bring that to the table. We want to work with that. This is not just about getting high on energy and feeling good, and that's it. We go on, no. This is a lifestyle, Quantum Flow, it's a lifestyle. You do the practice, and then you bring that practice to your life, so you can upgrade every area of your life. And then after the Quantum Flow activation, let's journal a little bit about this. How much could you connect with whatever's holding you back and release it during the practice? How much did you hold onto? How much did you surrender to the practice? Journal on this. Just observe, because the more you surrender, the deeper you're going to go, the faster you are going to transform your nervous system and your life. Amazing, familia; we did this again. Now, let's do this practice, and get ready for the next lesson, which is all about the core. The power of your energetic core. How to build it, how to cultivate it, and start really building that inner fire of presence. See you soon.

====================

LESSON 7: Quantum Flow - The Power of Alchemy
--------------------
<v ->Hey there.</v> How are you feeling? How are you doing? Thank you for coming back to the Quantum Flow Practice activation number four. Today we're going to go deeper into alchemy. Alchemy, that transformation from the nervous system, releasing the knots that have been set there from our past, from our body memory. We're going to go deep and release them and support the body for it to come back to its natural state, its natural intelligence, its natural presence. How amazing is that? It's important for you to know that this can feel uncomfortable, especially if you've never done it, and I just invite you to go deeper and ask the question all the time, "How committed am I to expand, to upgrade every area of my life through Ultra Presence?" That's going to help you go deeper and deeper in the work. So today we're going to go into a little bit of self-massage. Working from the navel; there's so many nerves around the navel; there's so much information that has been set there since we were in our mother's womb. Our navel is the symbol of all our connections, starting with ourselves, and then from the navel, we're going to open up the line of fire that connects all the way up into the solar plexus. So here I invite you to explore your body and stay wherever you feel there is some tension. Wherever you feel there is some pain, love yourself. But go deep into it through the breath. After we've done this work, we're going to repeat the spinal flow, through the breath, going a little bit faster than before to move the energy in your nervous system, and then we're going to expand our capacity to hold electricity, to hold energy in our nervous system. This is why we open the arms, we stretch, and we hold the breath. So when I say "Zip it in," it's... Yeah, you bring it through your mouth, and this expands your ribs to the limit. You start opening the space between the ribs. You start opening the space in the spine. You want more space for everything to come back to its natural state. After you've done this several times, you're going to feel amazing. So please, I invite you to find a comfortable sitting position where you have your spine straight; your shoulders are back, following up on the presence in your posture, and then of course, starting with the breath, all the way down into your belly. You want to expand the belly when you inhale, and you want to relax when you exhale. Sweet inhalation, sweet exhalation. Taking your time to close your eyes. If you want, you can bring the hands in front of your chest, connecting with your heart. With so much gratitude being here. So much gratitude for alchemy, for transformation, through my body. I release, I let go anything that's holding me back for being ultra present with myself, with others, in my purpose, in my business, in love, in life. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Take your time to tap into your own intention. Feel it with gratitude. And whenever you're ready, take a deep inhalation; expand your arms; open your eyes, big, open, wide eyes. Find that nice stretch, and then exhale and just relax. Allow your body to relax. Beautiful. Gently bringing your hands towards your navel, let's start massaging the navel as if you had a clock, a watch on your navel. You want to go clockwise. Yeah, so from right to left. Opening up, and just really explore your navel a little bit there. Wherever you feel there is tension, there is pain, stay there. Take a deep inhalation, and exhale, and allow the hands to go deep. Inhale, and then exhale through the hands; release. Relax your head, your neck. You want the energy to flow all the way up into your brain. Inhale; you expand your belly, and exhale; allow the hands to go in and explore. Release. Always inhaling through your nose, exhaling through your mouth. Let's do one more. Inhale as deep as you can. Hold it. Zip it in. Big belly, big Buddha Belly. Expand your belly. That's it. And now exhale. Allow the energy to expand all around you. Yes, from the core of your being, expanding the energy to your electromagnetic field. It happens naturally. Yes, now bring your hands back, and now through your hands, start walking from the navel a little bit up. Just exploring wherever. Oh, I felt it right there. That's where it's for me. Oh yeah, and then just start massaging wherever you feel a little bit of pain or uncomfortability. So your abdominals are completely relaxed. You're not pushing; you're not massaging your abdominal muscles. You're going deep. You want to get all the way into the nervous plexus there. That's it; once you found that point, let's breathe. Inhale. Inhaling, expand; relax your shoulders, your neck. Exhaling deep. Relax your neck when you exhale. One more. Nice. Take a deep inhalation. Hold it; zip it in through your mouth, big Buddha Belly, and expand. Expand it all around you. That's great. Inhale back. Now walk your hands a little bit higher and just explore, right, the sternum, where the bones are of the ribs, right, right underneath the sternum or around that zone. Just find another point there for you. Start massaging it. Remember, you're going into the nervous system. Take a deep breath. Exhale. Release. Allow the hands to go in. Inhaling. Surrender your weight towards the hands. Let them go as deep as they can. One more. Inhale. Hold it; zip it in. Big Buddha Belly. That's it. Hold it right there. Expand it all around you. Yes, allow the energy to move. Nice. Hands relax on the thighs. Deep breath. Now as you descend, navel in, clear the navel. All the way down. Inhale up. Exhale, navel in. Relax. Move the energy. I invite you to do the sound of ahh, to release more. Ahh. Ahh. If you can, go a little faster, if that feels good for you. If it doesn't feel good, you can go slow. What matters is navel in, your spine is flowing like water, and you're releasing from the navel, from the core of your being. You're releasing all that tension, all those knots, letting go of all that body memory, for that energy that was stuck is now flowing through your body. Keep going. Let's do seven more. Find your own rhythm. Three more. Last one. Inhale as deep as you can. Extend your arms. Now, find that extension. Now you're ready to expand more. Zip it in; expand it more. Inner smile. Relax. Relax your shoulders, your neck, your jaw. Open up to the energy; exhale, ahh, and just feel. Just feel; enjoy. Ahh. That's good. Let's go deeper. One more. Okay, just one more. You've got this. All right. Inhale. Exhale. Navel in clear. Releasing whatever's holding me back from being fully present in my life with myself in my purpose, with my body, with my soul. I am fully present with myself right now. I open up the energy through my body. Keep flowing, familia; you're doing great. Releasing anything that's holding you back from being present in your relationships, being present in your business. Move that energy. How committed are you? We're almost there. Seven more. Welcoming the flow. Welcoming the water. Yes. Three more. Ahh. Ahh. Last one. Ahh. Deep inhalation. Stretch your arms. Open yourself to new beginnings, new projects, new energies. Zip it in. And release, ahh. Receive. Let your body relax. Receive. See yourself fully present in your life right now. Loving yourself, loving your body, loving your life. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Surrounded by amazing people that love you, that support you, that are here for you, shining with you. Fully present for you, fully present for them. Fully present for yourself. Ahh. Feel this presence in every cell of your being. Breathe this presence into your belly. Ahh. And very gently, bringing the hands to the heart, one on top of the other, in front of the chest, acknowledging your heart, that place of love, that place of connection, that place of compassion. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Breathe into your heart. Allow that inner smile to blossom in your heart. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. Again, connecting with your intention. So much gratitude. Very gently opening your eyes, coming back. Thank you, familia. Beautiful work. We've got more alchemy to go into, but I invite you to come into this practice as often as you want to release more. You can go as deep as you can with the hands. That self-massage is amazing. And then get the breath going; get the spinal flow. I'm here for you. I'm here to support you. Thank you for showing up. We'll see you very soon.

====================

LESSON 8: Connect With the Power of Your Energetic Core
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, familia.</v> Today is the day of the fire, of the core, of passion, of how those gifts that are inside wake up in every cell of our being. There is a science; there is a way. It's not just like I open up, and I pray, and angels come and help me. There's no woo-wooness here, right? With Quantum Flow, we're demystifying spirituality, and all I want to share with you is that when you follow this methodology and you really do the work, do the alchemy, and commit to repeat and keep going and keep going, lesson after lesson, you see we're approaching it in different ways. You've seen the practice gets better and better, deeper and deeper. You start understanding more. You start waking up parts of your brain. Sometimes you feel like parts of your brain waking up; you feel like the heart is opening up and waking up. All of a sudden, you're walking in the middle of nowhere, and you feel like, oh, so much bliss, so much love for life, so much love for people, for who you are, for whatever. It's like gratitude you start tapping into. This state of gratitude that is your natural state. As we said before, when you tap into nature, nature is in full gratitude. It's the vibration of the 528 hertz. You can measure it. The 528 hertz is the vibration of the heart, the vibration of love, the vibration of abundance, and we can access this vibration in many ways. The way we are going deep right now is through Quantum Flow. Today is core-set. So we saw the three pillars already; core-set, setting back your core with the muscles, and now that that has happened, we're going to go deeper into it and wake up that fire. Now, that everything's rewired, we will wake up the fire deeper and deeper to bring even more passion, more inspiration, more drive. Who doesn't want more drive in their life? When you analyze, it's like, yeah, motivation is great. You can get motivation from all these people, and you can set goals and put yourself in that discipline, right? But it's coming from the outside. Once you have cultivated that drive, you wake up full of energy. You want to rock the world; it feels amazing. You love your life; you love yourself. You can't wait for another day to come, and again, just be you, and keep growing and keep evolving. That is something you cultivate. It's not something you're just born with, right? We actually lose it at a very young age, because if you see children, they are there; they live from their core; they are in their fire; they are in creativity; they're playing all over; they're singing. You see, they sing; they play. You give them a drum, and they play. They don't care what people think or where they are. They can be in front of a thousand people. They'll just do what they feel, right? It's kind of the extreme because they're not consciousness around it, but just for you to see that inner fire, that inner child; it's inside of you, and it's related to your gifts, to why you're here, to your purpose, okay? So what happens is coming back to that first part, which is your abdominal, which is like survival mode, these first three chakras. This is where all the energy has been stored, because in humanity, that's what we teach usually. Stay there. The first one is like survival, like take care of yourself that you don't die, and that's okay. Just stay alive, right? First chakra, that's distorted. It's all about staying alive and just being okay. Then the second one is the sexual energy. So it's like, okay, let me just reproduce, and let me just fulfill myself with sexuality, which is great, it's okay if you use it in the highest available vibration. If not, you're just going to be trying to fill that gap, as we saw before. And the third one is all about power. It's like I want more power. That's the ego. Let me keep going. Let me keep being more successful, having more money, having more stuff, doing more stuff. And that's where we stay in these three. But what's happening is that these three have been clogged. The nervous system, as we saw, has been crystallized; it's like they start raveling and creating certain knots that you actually can feel, right? And I'll show you a little bit when we do the practice. You can actually start massaging certain points and see how there's like crystals; it's like it's tense, and it comes from the nervous system, some of that tension. So you can access the nervous system; you can release, and that energy that's released, what happens is that you are opening it up, and you are unraveling it. As you know, energy is not created or destroyed. Energy just transforms. So clogged energy that's there just actually creating a block, once you release it, and you tap into it and unravel it, it's energy of creation. It's energy of manifestation; it's energy of presence. So what's happening when we start activating the core, we're moving the spinal fluid from the base of the spine and start waking up, start activating it, start sparkling it up for it to start ascending and not stay blocked right there in the belly. So this energy, you start teaching the energy, and this fluid to start going up, fully charged. It's like full of electricity. What happens, once it goes through that third nervous plexus into the fourth, which is the heart, you start opening up to more bliss, to inner freedom, to feeling good with life. It happens naturally once you start opening that part of your nervous system, and this happens with the Quantum Flow Method that we're going to be doing. And after that opens up, then it starts going up, and then you start expressing yourself. You start really saying no when you feel a no. You start saying yes when it's a yes. You're not anymore just pleasing people. You're really listening to that inner voice, which is what feels right, and it's not about you; it's about what is in the highest for all. Sometimes saying no, it's in the highest for all. It's the lesson for the person, and it's the lesson for you. Many times, this no is manipulated by ego, feeling bad to say no getting in the way, 'cause we're just here; we're not here, and we can't express ourselves. And that actually creates karma. It creates negativity; it creates a blockage on you because you're not really listening to that highest. And when you don't do that and act from that place, you're going to affect the other and not allow the other to tap into their own truth, their own expression, their own listening, right? And it's okay; it's all part of the game, but can we step the game higher? Can we start bringing that energy all the way up, opening up to that self-expression, divine expression, and then opening up that golden liquid coming up all the way into your pineal gland, right? And to enter the pineal gland, it goes in to what we call the animal brain, right? At the back of the brain, there's what we call the thalamic gate. And usually it's not flowing through the thalamic gate. There's like a blockage, which is connected to all the tension in the neck, to all the tension in the jaw, that's not really letting all this fluid charged, sparkled up, to enter your brain. So the more present we are with our body, with our energy, with what's happening really in the spine, in this channel of energy, the more we're present, the more it opens up, and the more it starts entering the brain, waking up the pineal gland through the breath, through the activation of the core. This starts pumping up and pushing against the pineal gland. When we hold the breath and we create that pressure, you start waking up very tiny microscopic crystals. So the more you wake it up, the more you move it, the more present you are of this energy ascending, the more starts moving all the calcium; the pineal gland has been calcified from what we've eaten, from all the heavy metals, from life. The more this pineal gland starts expanding, growing, evolving, and coming back to its natural state, which is full intuition, full connection with your vision, with your intention, with your clarity, with your focus, it comes from this place. The pineal and pituitary gland are not just about hormones, right? Some say like the pineal gland is there almost like doing nothing. It's not true. There's so much that's available through these glands. They're like the inner crystals of our brain, but we have to wake 'em up. We got to do the work. If not, we going to stay in the minimum, which is just here, just in survival mode. Let me just get with this life, this material life, and that's it, and not really explore all the gifts that are here in the presence of your temple. And this is what we call the real success. The real success is not about the outside. You are successful from within. You are open; you are fully embodying your gifts that come from your core, that come from that confidence, because you already know who you are. You've tapped into it. You don't have to read a book; they don't have to tell you. You don't have to do anything that's outside of you. You know. And once you've tapped into that knowing, once you've remembered who you are, because that's what we're doing, we are remembering the powerful soul that we are, why we came here to the planet. We are remembering our gifts, our frequencies, who we really are. Once you have that, and that's open in you, and you know, nobody can bring you out of it. All you're doing is expanding it more and more and more. But all this work comes from the core. From the core, you're building that drive. You're building that inspiration. You're building that energy that then expands in your life. Of course, you're going to take that to your business. Of course, you're going to come and have more ideas, more energy, more passion. You're going to influence everyone around you. You're going to go to the next level. You're going to want to open another business. You are going to want to expand more, not because you have to, not because you're proving anything. It's not related to the outside. It's just who you are. There's so much happening through you that it needs to be expressed. You can't keep it inside. You don't want to die with the music inside of you, right? You want to play that music to the world. That is the core, and we build it through all this work, until you find that confidence inside of you, until you feel unstoppable; you feel like the mountain, right? And that mountain, it's solid; it's strong; it's grounded; it's beautiful, right? It's there in the center, like being in the eye of the hurricane. At the same time, that mountain is a volcano. That fire is always there, and that fire wakes up through the work you're doing, starts opening up all the time, until you open up to the cosmos, until you open up all the channel fully open. That is the work we're doing. That happens through the presence, your body, your mind, your emotions, and your soul. And now that we understood a little better the science of the core and the importance of setting our core back to our natural state, let's do this. Let's go into the Quantum Flow practice. Let's open up to the gifts that are available for us. Let's set deeper that core into success and align to what we call the optimal flow state. After you've done the activation, I invite you to just journal. Journal on your experience. What is your vision of the core? What are your passions? What are your gifts? I would love to hear from you at least 10 gifts that you know, 10 qualities that you know you have, even though it's hard to accept it. I want you to go deep and surrender to them and know they are inside of you. Maybe they will wake up even more; you have more clarity after your practice. Go and journal on this. What does the core and that connection with the core mean to you, to your passions, to your drive, to your confidence? Anything you want to write about, please do so, so you can bring your brain, your mind, your body, your emotions into that oneness, into that core-set of "Here I am, and I connect with my willpower in order to manifest my full potential here and now." And from this inner volcano flowing through, I invite you to join us in our next lesson, where we will be after connecting the core, explaining a little bit how the energy expands and how you can cultivate that inner glow that is part of being in Ultra Presence. Thank you all so much. We'll see you very soon.

====================

LESSON 8: Quantum Flow - Unleash the Power of Your Energetic Core
--------------------
<v ->Pura vida, familia.</v> Welcome back to your Quantum Flow activation. Today we are going to focus on the core. So we started releasing a little bit of energy in our core. We started opening up through the breath. We will keep doing that, but now we want to start building and connecting the core with all the muscles in the body and start moving the energy from the core up into your brain. Let's do this. So please come, feet parallel, standing up, finding a comfortable standing position. Microbend your knees, just to really be present and grounded in your body. Whenever you're ready, bring your hands to your heart. Just connect with your intention, intention of living your life from the core, waking up that passion, all those inner gifts, waking up deeper layers of your purpose through the core and opening up to Ultra Presence through the core. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Whatever intention you want to bring in, now it's your time. Deep breath into your belly, and whenever you're ready take a deep inhalation; expand; open yourself to that intention, and then exhaling. Just relax. Relax right now, and feel into this beautiful forest. You're here with me, enjoying this energy of Costa Rica jungle. Yes, take it in through your eyes, and whenever you're ready, let's start activating the spine. So deep inhalation. Exhale through your mouth, inhaling vertebra by vertebrae. Just getting that flow going in your spine. Three more. Inhale; come back to center. Hold it; bend your elbows; open your heart, shoulders back; relax your neck, your jaw, and exhale; ground into the earth. All the way down into the earth. Beautiful. Now, let's activate that spine the other way. Just turning from one side to the other. Allow your hands to massage your organs. Very simple movement. And just observe that you're turning all the way up into the cervicals. You're opening space from the base of your spine all the way up into the cervicals. Your hands are massaging your organs. You're moving the energy from the core all the way up into your brain. And gently coming back to center. Gently coming back. Now we're going to do the same thing but with what we call the biophotonic breath. It's a breath through the mouth. You inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. At the end, it's like sending an arrow from the core of your being, okay? So when you turn, yeah, you can try that breath, and there's a vibration at the end. Try it with me. Yeah, your body vibrates. You want your body to move to shake. Okay? now let's do it with movement. Wake it up. Four more. Come back to center. Inhale into your heart. Hold it. Zip it in; hold it. Shoulders back. Open up. Exhale; expand. Allow your body to expand. Nice. Inhale all the way up, and exhale; activate your core. Bend your knees, and bring, it's like you're pulling two ropes down, and you want to take your elbows one towards the other, towards the navel. Inhale, you open pure feminine energy. Exhale, fire, passion. Wake it up. Let your body vibrate. Alive and awake. Couple more. Last one. Stay down. Stay down. Hands towards one another. Stay down. Activate all your muscles. Bend your knees; tuck in your tailbone. All your muscles are there a hundred percent. Keep breathing very soft and gentle. Hands are pushing one towards the other. All your muscles are fully active right now. You feel it? That's the fire waking up, reconnecting the core-set. One more. Nice. Let's open it up. Inhale. Hold it; hold it. Relax and exhale; expand. Expand it all around you. Allow your body to move. Nice. Inhale, back to center. Hold it, hands together. Hold it. Squeeze belly, navel in. Pelvic floor active. Activate and expand. Allow it to expand. After you contract comes the expansion. Yes. One more. Inhale. Working deep in the nervous system. You've got this; stay there. Breathe soft and gentle. Come on, warrior, warrior of light, warrior of love. Wake it up. Take a deep inhalation. Hold it. Hold it strong. And now open it up. Inhale; come forward. Exhale. Open it back. Now we're expanding from the core. Three more. Find your own rhythm. Opening from a seed to a huge tree, expanding your branches. One more. Stay open. Stay open. Expand even more. Take a deep inhalation; hold it there; zip it in; expand it more, and then receive. Relax. Allow it to flow through you. Become the water. Become the flow. Become the presence of life. That's it. Allow it to be; beautiful. Let's get it flowing. Inhaling. From the core, creating that spinal flow but incorporating the arms, getting the energy flowing from your core all around you. One more. Inhale to the heart. Hold it. Push; squeeze; zip it in. Squeeze. You've got this. Expand it all around you. Yes, I expand from my core. Beautiful. Open your feet 45-degrees angle. Good. Come back to the center, hands together. Feel the connection between your legs. Push towards the midline. Yeah. One foot towards the other. Feel how that connects all the muscles in your legs and connected to the core. We're reconnecting this, so pelvic floor is active; navel is in; legs are connecting too, and then hands together, all the muscles connecting now. Right there, you've got this. Deep breath. Navel in; pelvic floor active. Feel all your muscles fully present, but relax your jaw; relax your neck. You can enjoy this even when you're on fire. One more. Nice. Now, your left hand on top of the right hand. And now we're going to stretch the left leg. You're going to push; push towards the right leg. So inhale and exhale; push. And that push needs to come from your core. Okay? You're creating the own resistance. Inhale; bend your left knee. Exhale; push from the earth all the way into the hand. Okay? Yes. Come back. Let's do the other way. Change hands. Now the right one, it's pushing the left. So you push; you bend your left knee, and you push. Yeah. The push is coming from the foot. Yeah. So I inhale. When I exhale, I push on the foot, and I'm pushing towards the hand through my core. So my core is connecting all the way from the foot into my core, into the hand. One more. Come to center. Same thing. Now you have an imaginary hand here. You push center, core, foot; push. Waking that warrior energy, that fire inside of you. That confidence, that presence. Push. And do it more gracefully. Now you can, when you turn, you can raise your heel from the back leg, and you can completely stretch at the same time you are expanding. Nice. Now this one, hara, the sound "Ha!" So you turn fist. Ha! Center. Sweet and soft energy from your core. Ha! Sweet energy, inner smile. Ha! Ha! Two more. Ha! Wake it up from your center. Ha! Center. Hold it; zip it in; open it up more, and expand it all around you. Just observe; relax; enjoy the breath. Be present with yourself. Fully present with yourself. Inhaling, bring the hands into the core. Hold it; zip it in. And now from the core, expand it, feeling that fire that you woke up in your body, how it expands all around you. The magnetism of manifestation, the magnetism of presence, bring it in. Inhale and expand it. Inner smile. Enjoy that expansion from your core. One more. Inhale. Nice. Now stretch it. Tucking your tailbone, connect with the earth, and stretch it up to the sky. Connect with the heaven all the way up to the stars. Find that stretch. Relax your shoulders. Relax your neck. Relax your jaw. Zip it in, and expand it more. Touch the sky and receive. Sweet breath. Yes. Thank you; thank you; thank you. "I am alive and awake. I am confidence. I am strength. I am power. I am energy. I am Ultra Presence." Thank you; thank you; thank you. "I believe in myself. I know who I am." Thank you; thank you; thank you. Open up to that again. Deep inhalation. Zip it in; expand it. Beautiful inner smile, relax shoulders, neck, and jaw, and exhale; receive. Very nice. Receiver mode. Surrender mode. Bring that hands to the heart with so much gratitude. Bring your feet parallel one to the other from your heart. Offer this energy into the sky, and receive the energy from the sky through you all the way down to the earth. Find a nice space there to relax, to stretch, can move your hips from side to side, and that sweet, loving energy. After the fire, we bring the water. Bend your knees very gently, vertebrae by vertebrae, coming up. Inhale very sweetly. And then bringing that energy from the stars through you. All those gifts, all those ideas, all that creativity awakens through you. "I am the flow of life. I am the power of life. I am Ultra Presence." Thank you; thank you; thank you. From this space, relax your arms to the sides. Open your eyes, and feel yourself right now. Feel your presence. Feel your posture. Feel your breath. Feel how unstoppable you are. Yes. When you are in your center, you are unstoppable. Thank you, powerful being for sharing this with me. Thank you so much. We'll see you in our next lesson.

====================

LESSON 9: Expand Your Presence & Inner Radiance
--------------------
<v ->All right, familia.</v> Hope you are doing amazing, connected with your core, with your passion, ideas, energy flowing through your body. How amazing is it to do this work and bring this mindset and start embodying it in your lifestyle. And also, if you're not, take it easy; you have this course to do it as many times as you want. The more you do it, the more you open up. So don't worry about that. Just follow the process with patience. Now is the time to shine, or at least understand what radiance means and how it happens from the inside out. So inner radiancy is something you cultivate with time through your core. That fire that we talked about, that confidence, that energy, that passion. Amazing. But what is it for if you're not bringing it out, if you're not sharing your gifts, if you're not sharing your codes, if you're not letting this light, this energy, this inner joy expand all around you? And of course learning how to do it at an energetic level. Again, that nervous system, as you saw, is directly connected with the chakras, these vortexes of energy. So the more we open the nervous system, the more you are expanding that energy all around you. Chakras can be now measured. You can take photographs and see what color is your aura or your electromagnetic field. So it's something we can now prove with science. And this is of course, coming from the nervous system. It's not just something random that all of us, all of a sudden I'm vibrating in this or that color; it's all coming from the work that you've done from within. So after doing this work of the core, we start opening up and cultivating the energy of the mitochondria as we said before. We start teaching the mitochondria to really start getting strong and powerful and the most efficient they can be. This is actually the code for longevity. It's all in your mitochondria. The amount of energy you can hold and the amount of energy you have available for you right now is related to your mitochondria, which of course then connects with the nervous system. And if your nervous system can hold that energy, then you are shining bright. So let's demystify a little bit this concept of shining bright. "Yeah, I am light. Oh yeah, it's so good, right?" Yeah. You know the metaphor. No. When we say, "I am light," we can prove that we are light. If you go and observe the nervous system and study the nervous system, you will see there are billions of neurons, billions of cells in the nervous system. Imagine that only in the brain you have a 100 billion neurons. Only in the brain. And then, the whole nervous system, it's like a huge brain. How many neurons are there? Now, you know the synapses you saw already. You know the connection between the neurons, how any impulse, any thought, any emotion, any movement, any breath is completely lighting up your whole nervous system, and how your whole nervous system communicates is through light. It's pulses of light; there is light pulsation. It literally lights up and communicates from the tip of your toes to the tip of your head, right? It's a full connection. Now, how much light is there? How much is available to us to create this connection? That depends on your nervous system and how much you've worked it out. How much you've gone to the gym, right? The Quantum Flow gym to do this and really open it up. So the more you practice this methodology and understand it, the more you start cultivating the biophotons. We are producing biophotons. Just to bring a little bit of science to what biophotonic energy is, it's the energy from the sun. The light from the sun is emitted because of the biophotons. Those biophotons we have inside us. It's our nervous system. It's the way to communicate. It's the same. It's biophotonic energy. That's why it's like we are a reflection of the universe. Of course, we are the sun. Of course, we are the earth. All the minerals of the earth are in our bodies. The same amount of water that is in the earth, more or less, 3/4, so 75%, is in our body. We are a reflection of that. And our nervous system is the one that reflects the light. So when we're talking about "light up yourself," accept that you are light; accept that you're here to shine. We are talking for real. It happens on a physical level, but then you can be lit up and really have your eyes shining and your skin shining and your aura shining. Next level is are you sharing this light? Are you conscious that this light is actually influencing others? And not only the ones that are around you but the whole world, the whole planet is feeling you and your light. We are all connected. There's this quantum field that connects us all through our electromagnetic field. It's science. There's really no separation between us. But we think there's space. There's no space. There's just more space between the atoms, but there's really no space. We are all connected. So anything that's happening with anyone could affect you, right? And it could affect you in a negative way or actually in a positive way. This is where you start working with the radiancy and being aware that you are a radiant being of light and that you are actually emanating that light outside of you and you are not being affected by others. So what does this mean? This means sharing your gifts, being you, sharing your smile, your hugs, your words, whatever comes through you, accepting the leader, the teacher that you are, maybe just with your presence, just by being you in silence. If you are emanating that energy around you, you are sharing your gift. It's not about doing big talks and being the amazing speaker. If that's not your gift, then that doesn't come through. It's okay. It can be just with your presence. But being aware of that. Embodying your gifts and sharing your gifts, your message, your codes with the world. The world is waiting for you. There's humans out there that want to feel you, want to hear you. They're waiting for your unique codes. Nobody else has those codes. Once you're aware of that, and you tune into that, and you cultivate that, you start letting it be without, "Oh, they're going to judge me. What are they going to think? Am I here trying to teach something? Who am I? I haven't done really all the work other peoples have done." All this stuff that is just limiting beliefs from your ego that's really holding you back, because the one that empowers itself more when you share your gifts is you. It's not about them. Some people you can share or be, and they won't even notice you. They don't only accept you, they won't even... And you know, it's okay. You don't share more. You don't need to, but you do it because of you, to empower yourself, to light up. Every time you share your gift, every time you hug someone when you felt to hug, every time you felt to call that person and you did it, every time you did anything that came from your gut, your soul, your core, every time you do it, you're nurturing that light. You're expanding that light inside of you. And this is when we start playing a little bit, right? It's like a cosmic universal game here where we are pulsating. You go into the core; you cultivate your passion; you're with yourself; you're building your nervous system; you're doing that inner work; you're sharing with the world. You're taking in; you are receiving; you're giving; you're receiving; you're giving. It's a universal pulsation. That's how cells are alive. That's how the universe pulsates. It's the way life pulsates. Why do we let our ego get in the way and stop? Or I'm a giver and I just give, give, give, give, give. Or I'm just receiving like a vampire, feeling, "Poor me, I need more. I need more attention. I need more people to be with me. Why are people not there for me when I need them?" Right? We can be in both extremes, or we can find a balance. Learn to receive; learn to cultivate your core, and at the same time, open up to constantly just sharing, just being you, the authentic you. That is the universal pulsation. And that takes us into what we call the pranic breath. Prana means energy. Pranic breath is breath that happens through prana. So I'm not talking about the breath with the nose. That's always happening, right? Or the mouth. I'm talking about an energetic connection that's always available to you, but nobody taught us that. So this connection, what's happening is like energetically we're connected to the center of the earth, to the electromagnetic frequencies we saw in grounding from the earth. We are always connected to the earth, even if we're not like fully connected with our feet on the earth directly, right? Barefoot, we are always connected. It's better if we're barefoot, but that connection is always there. We wouldn't be alive if that doesn't happen. It's something you actually can measure. So this connection is there constantly, all the way up into your pelvic floor in your spine, constantly. Then the earth is nurturing us, not only with food but with energy, right? So we also have the connection with the sun or the stars. This is through the crown, is this chakra of "I am," is the chakra of wholeness. And through that chakra, through the pineal gland, through the pituitary gland, we are receiving those energies that biophotonic energy that's available to us if we're open and receptive. If not, it comes at the minimum just to survive. But you can be very open. Your channel, your capacity to receive can be so expanded that you're fully connected to this energy, fully in intuition, fully in living your life from that space of full genius, right? That's what being in your genius is. You're fully tapped in. And when you're aware of that, that energy coming from the heavens or the sky or the stars or the suns, and that energy from the earth it's coming through you, through your crown, through your feet, and it connects in the heart. The pulsation happens in the heart. It's the union of heaven and earth, and then it expands, and it goes to the heart. This is always happening. It's the universal pulsation that happens through you. It's the pranic breath, right? The energy breath. This is always happening. So if you're aware of this, right? And you're feeding yourself through this, and you are aware that you are not taking people's energy through your heart, through your core, you start really understanding what the presence, energetic presence means. What it means to be protected by this golden bubble, this golden light that surrounds you when you're aware of this energy. You're not anymore open to everybody's thoughts or frequencies; it's all frequencies; it's all vibrations that can affect you. You think it's your thoughts, but it's collective thoughts that are not yours. And you're taking them as yours. Same as emotions. Someone comes angry, and all of a sudden, you're affected. Someone has fear, and you're affected. You don't even know it. But once you start cultivating this pranic breath, this connection in your heart, which is the center, and you start visualizing and knowing that you have a golden bubble all around you, that protects you, and you're actually breathing through the top and the bottom. And then if you want, it's nice; radiancy is you're expanding that light. Like if you're giving roses, flowers to humanity. So you're not taking what people are vibrating, but you are giving, and it's with so much love. It's like a tree that is giving its fruits. This is what I do when I go to places like a mall, like a concert, like places that there's so many energies. I'm sure you felt it. You feel drained, like it feels heavy; it feels like dense. This is because you're fully open, and you're not aware of what's going on. You're not present. Being present is knowing that bubble, that energy, sharing your love, sharing even if you're not even talking to people, it's happening. You're not affected by them. You actually feel you're fully in your purpose because you're really sharing like positive energy with everyone around you. If they're aware or not, doesn't matter. You do it for you. So it's very important to bring this awareness. Now that you understand the science, you are understanding more who you really are and how amazing you are. Naturally, you don't have to do anything about it, just being aware. And through Quantum Flow this awareness opens up; this awareness expands, and then you can take it into your lifestyle. Another example that I would love to share with you is something that would happen for me in workshops, and when I was speaking, sometimes I'm speaking in front of 5,000 people. Imagine all of those energies. Or I'm doing a workshop where people are releasing so much; there's so much going on, from their past, from their beliefs, from their mindset, from them projecting on me because I'm the teacher; I'm the leader. It's like they have to get it on someone, as if I was doing something. And all I'm doing, I'm facilitating for them to open up to this. And they're not even aware of that. But you can feel all these energies like daggers. I used to be very affected. Guys, I used to do a workshop, and I was done for two days. Couldn't move from my bed; couldn't get up like if I was sick; had nothing, no flu, nothing. I was completely drained, and not only physically but I could feel like dense and heavy, and I didn't understand. After being in bliss and seeing people light up and wake up into parts of themselves they've never seen before, feeling full bliss, take their life to the next level, send me messages. I would lie in bed and like receive all these messages of all the most amazing news of what had happened to them. Imagine for me how disconnected I would feel. It's like I feel like an impostor. I feel like a hypocrite. I feel like I'm not really aligned to what I'm teaching. But it wasn't that; it was beyond that. I wasn't embodying this teaching that I am telling you even though I kind of knew about it. I wasn't an expert on it, but I wasn't putting it in practice. So it would really affect me until I learned, until I committed to be fully present wherever I'm at, with whoever I'm at, especially if I'm in a group where there's a lot of energies and there's a lot going on; that's when I'm going to protect myself more, be fully open and helping but be so present with not letting these energies affect me. That's when you really start tuning into your power. That power from within, that power of being unstoppable, where anyone, anything can happen, and you're there in the eye of the hurricane. I mean, we're human. You can come and go, but sooner or later, very fast, you come back to your center. It's like, "No, no, I don't tolerate this anymore. Let me just check in with myself. Where's my mind? Where's my emotions? Where's my body? Where's my connection with my soul? With my highest self? Boom, I'm back. Thank you. This is who I am. That's it. Coming back." And you are unstoppable. That's what we're doing here guys. And now it's time to take it into the practice, time for Quantum Flow and how to feel this and cultivate this radiancy through our body. And then how to take it in our life. And of course, I invite you today to just reflect on this. How is that inner glow? How is that inner radiancy? Are you sharing your gifts? What are ways that you can share your gifts that you're not doing right now? How does it feel when you do it? Are you sharing your message, your music? I invite you to just journal on all of this. What can you upgrade just with your mindset? Just by being aware? It's so beautiful knowing that that inner light, that inner glow is healing people around you. It's influencing them. It's inspiring them. Are you aware when you enter a room that you have that radiancy flowing all around you? Are you aware that that is actually influencing and inspiring others? Just be aware, be present on that, and cultivate it more; cultivate it through your breath, through your mindset, through your presence. So, of course, this journaling experience, or soul work that we call, is aligned to the Quantum Flow activation, the methodology. The more you go into it, the more you expand this radiancy. And then you'll see in the next lesson how this radiancy is connected to that universal radiancy and how you can expand your impact in the world through this. Congratulations, familia. You did it. You finished part number two. Now we're going on the last track. Is going to be amazing to understand deeper all the energetics behind this work. Feel it even more, and take it to the next level. Thank you all so much for your presence. We are on track. Mucho amor, familia. From my heart, all the love to your heart, one heart. Pura vida.

<v ->Welcome back to your Quantum Flow activation, familia.</v> Today we're going to expand more into radiancy and remind our body of the channel of light that it is and how protected we are all the time. How not to get affected by anyone's energies. So, this starts through the work in the nervous system and expanding and being aware of what we are creating around us. All right? Please come to a standing position. Bring your hands to your heart, whatever that feels good for you. I invite you to close your eyes and just be present with your breath, allowing your breath to come through the nose, wherever you're at right now. Observing thoughts, observing emotions, observing sensations, and just coming back to the breath. I invite you to be present with your breath, that sweet, loving breath that opens you, that heals you, that supports you in Ultra Presence. And now, through your mind, through your intention, let's direct the breath all the way down to our feet. So when you exhale, exhale all the way down, the energy through your hips, through your legs, all the way down to the feet. Inhale, and bring the energy from the feet into your heart. With your mind, when you exhale, bring the energy all the way down to your hips, to your feet, all the way down to the earth, to the center of the earth, right there. And when you inhale, bring the energy from the center of the earth into your heart. Just remembering that connection that's always there. We're just reminding our body, and coming back to that natural state. Inhaling, I bring the energy from the earth into my heart. Exhaling, from my heart back to the earth. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Then, whenever you're ready, breathing into your heart. And when you exhale, exhaling all the way up into your crown, inhaling from your crown into your heart. This is all through your mind, knowing, feeling, or seeing that this is happening. Next, exhalation. From your heart, allow the energy to go into the brain, the crown, and all the way out to the sun. And from the sun, inhale that energy into your heart. Thank you; thank you; thank you. That pulsation is happening all the time. From my heart, I exhale out into the sun. From the sun, I inhale that biophotonic energy through my crown into my heart. And with that connection of that bridge that I am between heaven and earth, connect with your intention. Whatever you're calling into your life right now. "I am light." "I am energy." "I am radiancy." Whatever feels good for you right now. And so it is. And whenever you're ready, take a deep inhalation; open your eyes; expand your arms all the way up, and then exhale; bend your knees, and come down, vertebrae by vertebrae, all the way down. Feet are parallel. Allow your head to hang. Inhale all the way up. Expand. Open yourself, connecting with the sun, with all the stars. Exhale. Surrender to the earth. Relax. Let go of all the burden you're carrying down to the earth. One more. Exhaling down. Relax your neck. Allow your head to hang. Inhale all the way up. Now hold it; zip it in. And with your fingers, tap in your thymus gland, right there in the center of your chest. Stay right there. Wake it up. That's it. And then exhale, and open it up. Let's do a couple more. Today's all about the heart. Inhale. Hold it. Tap it into the center of the chest right there. Remember your intention. Repeat your intention in your mind, that's what you're calling in. This is the heart-set. And then expand it. Beautiful. One more. Inhale. Wake up the thymus gland, immunologic system. Love, compassion, freedom, expansion. Wake it up, and then expand it. Nice. Take a deep inhalation, and then, exhaling, bend your knees and come, arms come forward; bend your knees; ground into the earth. Yes. Wake up those roots. Right there. I'm with you. Okay? So inhale. Exhale. Bring the hands back; hips comes forward. Inhale. Yeah? Core and expansion into the heart. Beautiful. Remember the biophotonic breath? We vibrate at the end. Mm-hmm. Follow your own rhythm. Remember to vibrate. All the muscles in your body want to vibrate. You're waking up that energy, that electricity in your body. You've got this. Three more. Last one. Stay there. Strong. Strong. Present. Fully present. Inhale; open. Hold it. Zip it in. Now expand it. Expand it beyond your limits. Expand. And then bring it in. Bring it in. Allow your body to flow. The intelligence of your body wants to take over. That's the flow state. Allow it to happen. Very nice. Okay, well done. Inhale, and then exhale; activate the core. Inhale. Deep. Last one. Stay down. Ball of fire. Hands together. Ball of fire. Chin in. Bend your knees; remember reconnecting the core. And now we're going to break it all the way open, into the heart, okay? Stay there. Sweet breath. Full fire, but your breath is soft and gentle. All your muscles are connected. You ready? Take a deep inhalation, and exhale; expand. Inhale. So you can go slower, and I also invite you to go faster. Keep going; keep going. Careful with your neck. Careful when you go back; don't push your head back. Protect your neck. This is more about opening the heart. Keep going. How committed are you to radiate? How committed are you to open up? How committed are you to expand? Keep going. Deeper. Yes. You've got this. Keep going. That's it; enjoy it. Allow yourself to get lost in the movement. No time, no space. Allowing it to flow. The trance state, Quantum Flow state; allow it to flow. Three more. And stay. Deep breath. Open your eyes. Full presence. Zip it in. Expand it as if they're pulling your hands from one to the other. And then bring it through the heart. Let it flow. Let it flow. Nice. Now, very gently, letting the water happen through your body. So this is all about the flow. Start just very gently feeling it through your spine; starts happening through your body. The more you do it, the more it happens naturally. It's your body just taking over. The intelligence of your body just taking over. So, that same water flow, we're going to take it to expand our electromagnetic field. Yeah? So, staying in that flow of the water. Okay? Now we're going to take it even deeper into radiancy. Hands together. Stay soft inside. You know what to be water is now, huh? Hands together. You're going to bring the fire. Your core, navel in. Pelvic floor active. Fully present. Bend your knees. Inhale. Exhale. Activate. Hands together, navel in, pelvic floor active. Keep the abdominals active. Core active, inhale; bring it into the heart. Heart-set. Hold it. Keep squeezing. Squeeze your belly. Remember, you're bringing the energy from the bottom into your heart. Hold it there. And then expand it. Yes. Rewiring your whole nervous system. Inhale. Exhale; bend your knees. Hands together. Connect the hands with the core. Legs, everything is one core. Inhale; bring the energy from the earth into your heart. Squeeze. Squeeze, navel in. Pelvic floor active. Squeeze. Relax your neck; relax your jaw. Hold it, and expand it. Nice. Now we take it into the brain. Deep inhalation. Exhale down. From the earth, bring it all the way into your feet, into your legs, through your spine. Liquid golden light flowing through your spine all the way up into your third eye. Right there into the pineal gland. Hold it. Squeeze. Navel in. Activate your pelvic floor. That's it. Relax your shoulders, your neck, your jaw, and open it up. Open it up. Allow your body to flow. Yeah. Yeah. Always allowing the body to flow. Let's do it again. Inhale; exhale. Core active, all the muscles active. Inhale, very gently bring that energy all the way up into your brain. Squeeze. Keep squeezing. Zip it in. Keep squeezing. Yes. Open it up. It's focused on your brain right now. Close your eyes, and then expand it all around you. Yes. Please always respect your rhythm. Don't push it too much. Just enough. If you get dizzy, it means you exceeded yourself, okay? Very important to respect yourself. One more. Inhale. Bring that energy up. All the way up. Into your brain, into your third eye. Squeeze. Relax your shoulders, your neck, and your jaw. Allow it to all go all the way into your brain. Zip it in, and open it up. Yes, that's it. The more you do this, the more you'll get it, the more you'll flow naturally. I promise you. Okay? So now, from this space of full, full opening, of full radiancy, I invite you to open your feet, 45-degrees angle. And then, again, find that water flow. You always want to come back to the flow when you have activated your core and your muscles; you want your your joints to flow, yeah? You want the water flowing in your body. So explore everything. Your neck, your shoulders, your elbows, your wrists, your hips, your knees, you're juicing it up. Every joint in your body, it's a doorway to energy, yeah? And then start opening it up. Opening it up. Find that movement. Find that expansion. Yes. Close your eyes. And just feel into the water. So what kind of water are you? Are you a very sweet, gentle river? Are you a waterfall? Are you the waves of the ocean? Like, how does water flow through you right now? Explore that. And once you feel into your rhythm, your way to flow, now expand all that around you. Radiate that energy. Expand your arms, and start playing with any color that comes to mind. Surround yourself with that color. Expand your auric field. Expand your energy. You are the creator of your field. You are the one that opens up the field to its full potential. Through your breath, through your movement. Open it up. Trust what feels right for you, and play with it. And enjoy it. Celebrate it. Celebrate your intention right now. How good it feels to move your body. Let it dance. Let it play. Let it move, expanding into radiancy. Expanding from the center into radiancy. Yes. And very gently, coming back. Coming back. Coming back to center. Sweet breath into your heart. Inhaling all the way up to the sky, connecting to the sun. Exhaling. Receive that energy. The pranic breath between heaven and earth. Exhaling all the way down to the earth. Remember that connection with the earth. Bring that energy from the earth into your heart. And then share the energy all around you. And visualize yourself in daily life. Wherever you go, the channel is open, and you're creating that golden field all around you. Inhaling into your heart, and then surrounding yourself with that golden light, golden bubble that protects you. Close your eyes, and feel into that. The golden bubble that protects you. "I am safe. I am protected. I am universal radiance." Thank you; thank you; thank you. "I remember who I am. I am Ultra Presence. I am." Mm. Right now, I invite you, if you feel to meditate, sit down. If you feel to lie down, perfect. If you feel to journal, it's always following your flow. Remember, Quantum Flow, it's about you. It's about your flow. And from there, tapping into the presence. Your presence. Mm. Bringing the hands to the heart. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Well done, familia. Deeper and deeper. Well done. We'll see you soon.

Part 3 - Matching Your Radiance to a Radiant Universe

====================

LESSON 10: From Good Luck to Synchronicity
--------------------
<v ->Hola; hola, familia.</v> Welcome back to Ultra Presence. How to be fully aligned in synchronicity. Thank you all for being here. Thank you all for saying yes to your presence. We've seen how we are building that presence from the ground up, grounding it, then going into alchemy to release, then going into the core, connecting with your passion, your fire, then expanding that into radiancy, owning your gifts, your light. And then it's really about how we flow in life. How do we bring that into life? And that is synchronicity. How do we align to the highest vibration possible? What's available to us? Indeed, this happens only through presence, presence in every layer of our being. So we're going to go deeper into that science of pulsation, universal pulsation. How do I know, how do I feel, how do I trust that pulsation that is guiding me all the time? How do I listen to it more? And how do I let go of that philosophy, that belief of good luck; some people have more opportunities; some people have less. You're born in a place or in another with a certain nationality, with certain money or status or whatever that is. That is really just a story. When you analyze who we really are, and you let go of your name, you let go of your country, you let go of your language, I am a soul. I am light. I am here and now. And that is the presence. And once you tap into that, the rest doesn't really matter. It starts flowing through you. I want to share a little story about how I applied this into my life. I've been fully committed to this work since a very young age, and I was always in that search; I'm a truth seeker, right? So I was always looking for different paths and looking to just reveal whatever the truth was for me. And release whatever wasn't part of the truth. So I was already teaching yoga and doing healing, and I had my own healing center. I was married; I had my son. A beautiful family life. Going everything really well to society, right? Hundreds of students, so much abundance flowing through the center all the time. We grew from a very small center to bigger, bigger, bigger. We had a huge center right there in Curridabat in Costa Rica. So I'm like I'm doing really well. Like wow, I love so many people; so many people love me. They look for me for advice, right? I'm like, this is feeling really good. But there's a part of me deep inside that says, "Juanpa, there's more; there's more." And the visions I would constantly have was like I need to share myself with the world. This is more global. And it's great; right now it's here, the community and whatever you're doing, but the message was always it was bigger. And I kind of didn't listen to this message for a long time. I was like always staying there in that comfortable zone where it felt good. I had like my safe zone. But something inside was always boiling, always boiling, like there's more. And it wasn't like I'm not satisfied; it wasn't from a place of ambition. I need more money, or I need more things. No, guys; it wasn't even that. It wasn't about something external. It was more about listening to those inner gifts to who I really was, and what I was to share here with the world. And how I could like let go maybe of my personality and the place I was born and the people I loved around me and all that. And I had to release a lot. I had to release, let go of a lot. It was a very deep journey for me. So I had this perfect life, right, on the external. But on the internal, it didn't feel like that. I wasn't happy with my marriage. I wasn't happy with my relationship with my son and her two sons. Like I wasn't happy with who I was, and how I was showing up in the world. There was all this I was carrying inside of me that I wasn't dealing with. And there was all these things going on in our relationship where we were almost faking, making believe that everything was fine. People were looking up to us like the perfect couple and all those things, like all those games we play in society that mask. And I played that game. I played that game for a while, until I like, "I need to get raw and real. I need to just go inside and feel what's going on. What do I need to do? What do I need to let go of?" And it was a full introspection. It was very, very painful, guys. I went through a lot of loss. I had to break free from everything, everything, from the marriage, from like the center, my community, my people. It was like I need to come back to Juanpa. I need to come back to my core and get raw and real with myself. I had to fast. I fasted for almost 75 days, guys. Like water, juice, fasting here and there. Completely isolated. I needed to be with Juanpa. I needed to come back to my presence 'cause I knew I was playing a game, and I was kind of done with it. I couldn't continue playing that game. I was betraying myself. And yes, this meant coming out of my comfort zone. This meant being open to, well, maybe I can't even pay for the food for my child right now. It meant everything, but I had to go through it. I'm very extremist. I don't recommend you guys do this, but it was my path. And it brought me to a place of fully acknowledging my vulnerability, fully acknowledging who Juanpa was in every way, not just the guru that they put me there in a pedestal and the perfect father and the perfect husband, whatever, which wasn't perfect as I was fully dramatic. But playing that perfect role that it was just not enough for me. So I broke free from it, and I started connecting with the real power, the real power of Juanpa, the real confidence, the raw and real of me how I was, with my sadness, with my depression, with my frustration, with my anger, everything. I was done with trying to be just the coach, the healer. For me, it's like if I'm going to help humanity, I need to be the most human I can be, 'cause I know there's so many people out there that need this. I knew it in my heart, first for me, and then it's like I see so many leaders out there that are just masks. There's so many masks, and people put them in the pedestal when we're all humans; we're all in the same path; we're all going through the same. We all have the same journey. What happens is maybe you're a little more ahead of the journey, and that's where we help each other. But we're all human. So acknowledging this humanness, I started journaling just on all the parts of me. Not trying to be in a certain way. Just releasing, letting go of, breathing through it. All the practice you've been doing with Quantum Flow, I did it very deeply. Deep meditations; deep journaling. Just opening up. Being open and receptive. Surrendering. And I started receiving so much information. I started writing so much. And I wasn't even looking for anything. All of a sudden, I had an invitation to go to Hanuman Festival, which I had connected with the creator of Hanuman Festival a couple of years back. And all of a sudden, he was calling me to come and teach there. And then I was called to go to Bhakti Fest because one of my teachers was teaching there, and he brought me in. All of a sudden, the world opened for Juanpa, the world. I wasn't looking for it; it opened up to me because my inner world opened up, because I got to be present with myself, all of me. Not the perfect image of me, all of me. And from that place, all the doors opened up, and that opened me for seven years of nonstop traveling, guys. All over the world. All my dream countries. One after the other, teaching Quantum Flow, speaking, being with people, creating community, working online. I was called by Mindvalley. All of a sudden, I was like in part of my path, I was like I'm called to work with entrepreneurs. I'm called to work deeper. I want to help leaders that are already influencing millions of people, right? Like I knew it in my heart. And even though a part of me was like "Who do you think you are, Juanpa? From Costa Rica in the middle of nowhere. Come on, man, who's going to listen to you? Like all these leaders from all over the world?" Of course, I had that voice inside of me, but I didn't listen to that. I knew that was my ego. I knew that was my little me. I knew that was my comfortable zone keeping me there. It's my unconscious mind keeping me in my safe place, where it feels good, where I'm comfortable, where I'm safe, where my ego's not going to die, right? Let me just play here 'cause I don't know what's going to happen if I come out of the box. It's part of like how we've been wired in the system. So for me, letting go of that, it's like I release everything, all identity, everything I think I am, where I'm from. I am. And I'm guided. Thank you, spirit; thank you; thank you. I'm humble, open and receptive. Guide me. And all of a sudden, it's like you've got to start speaking English to the world. You're going to be called by places where it's English-speaking. And I started doing posts in English. And what do you think my community started saying? Oh, now he's playing; he's a gringo, or he's international. Oh my God, he's in his ego. All this stuff that, of course, touched me at the beginning. But again, guys, I didn't get lost. I didn't stay in my little me because I knew there was something bigger. I knew it wasn't about me. Your story, it's not about you. Once you're fully present to who you are, it's not about you. It doesn't matter what they say; it doesn't matter what they think; it doesn't matter the external world; it's about you aligning to you in your highest self. And if that means traveling the world and speaking to millions, or if that means being with your family, fully present, being the best mom you can be, the best dad you can be, being present in your body, being present with the people around you. Being present in nature. Being fully you, aligned to love, aligned to this light, this energy that's inside of all of us that makes our heart beat. When we align to that, we are guided by that. It's not our ambition; it's not our desire. It goes beyond that. Desire and ambition, it's okay; it's part of the ego, it's part of the game, but we can choose deeper all the time. You can choose deeper. You look at the ego; look at all the parts. The little me, that "I'm not good enough," and the big me, that "I think I'm so much." Look at all of them; laugh at them 'cause that's not you. It's beyond that. You are energy. You are the universe. Universal energy is flowing through you. That is presence. And when you allow it to be, the whole universe supports you. You don't have to push anymore; you don't have to prove anything. I had been proving myself all my life, proving I'm the best coach, proving I'm the best teacher, proving I know so much, proving I'm the best father. Oh my God, proving what? Why? Why proving so much? 'Cause there's an emptiness in me that I'm trying to fulfill with this proving, with this external approval, instead of internal, internal awakening, internal opening, internal receiving, internal being, just being. And by constantly observing every part of me, every thought, every emotion, and just choosing, this is not aligned to my higher self. Uh uh, let me burn this down, this down, this down, this down. This yes; this feels good. This feels amazing. Yes, I love this. Let me feed more into that. Let me feed more into the Juanpa that's confident, that's strong, that's vulnerable, that shares his truth, that is himself without whatever anybody thinks. I want to nurture that Juanpa. I want to nurture that authenticity. And I started doing that every day with every breath, any moment I had to be aware of this and be open. And this is how by the practice of presence in every part of my being, I opened up for that little me that was there in the comfortable zone, with my nervous system that was wired to stay small, to stay protected, full of all these masks and all these layers that weren't really letting the light shine through. So my nervous system was collapsed; my nervous system was constricted, was all raveled up. And I started working on it and fasting, opening, Quantum Flow, releasing, meditating, journaling, opening it up, opening it up, opening it up to be fully present to allow the message to come through, to allow the energy to flow, and that's when you start feeling the universal pulsation. That is when, like when your nervous system is open and relaxed, and you feel safe; then this pulsation happens through you. Then you are more in synchronicity. That's where you are aligned to life flow. It's the flow of life. Life is flowing through you. It's not running at you or against you. Life flows through you. So now I want to invite you to allow life to flow through us just for a couple of minutes. I invite you to find a comfortable position, please. And just be aware of your posture. Maybe close your eyes. Just invite yourself to be present with yourself. Allow yourself to... Allow yourself to be. Bringing awareness to your breath, the simplicity of the breath. The sweetness of the breath. Welcoming the breath, thank you; thank you; thank you for each inhalation. So grateful. Thank you, universe, of reminding me who I am. Thank you, air, for bringing the prana, the energy. Light me up. I remember who I am. Beyond my name, country, language. Any identification. I am. Through the sweetness of the breath, and come to that presence. Bringing your awareness to the air entering the nose. Very gently, very sweetly. Caressing your nose. Going up all the way into your brain. Down through the throat. All the way into the lungs. Feel the whole path. Your inhalation is very soft and gentle, almost imperceptible. In your exhalation, just notice how the air comes warm. How it feels in your body. It's coming out of you. Just being present. Through how your body relaxes in your exhaling. Naturally relaxes. I surrender. I let go of any attachment, of any image, anything I think I am. When I inhale, lighting up that inner truth, lighting up my true self with love. So much love; so much gratitude. Every cell of my being takes all that love. Every cell of my being receives that love. It's so simple. So real. And every exhalation is just an opportunity to release, let go of any part that's not aligned with my true self. Thank you; thank you; thank you. I am. I am. I am. And very gently, just staying in this sweet space inside of you. Very gently coming back in your time to open your eyes. Find a nice stretch if you need to. Always follow your own flow. And whenever you're ready, I invite you to journal a little bit about this. What does synchronicity meant to you, and where do you feel you have been following these limiting beliefs around good luck and opportunities and you playing small? Whatever this touched in you, I invite you to look at it and be with it, to bring it to the table, so we can release it and go deeper and deeper to your true self, to why you're here, to your Ultra Presence. Thank you; thank you; thank you all for being in this journey together again. Thank you for doing the work you're doing. We're going to go into optimal flow and how we can live sustainably. That optimal flow in every area of our life. See you very soon.

LESSON 10: Meditation - Be One With the Pulse of the Universe

So now I want to invite you to, to allow life to flow through us. Just for a couple of minutes. I invite you to find a comfortable position, please and, um, just be aware of your posture. Maybe close your eyes. Just invite yourself to be present with yourself. Allow yourself to allow yourself to be bringing awareness to your breath. The simplicity of the breath, the sweetness of the breath. <silence> Welcoming the breath. Thank you, thank you, thank you for each inhalation, so grateful. Thank you universe for reminding me who I am. Thank you air for bringing the pana, the energy. Light me up. I remember who I am beyond my name, country language, any identification I am. 

And through the sweetness of the breath, I come to that presence. I bringing your awareness to the air, entering the nose very gently, very sweetly, caressing your nose, going up all the way into your brain, down through the throat, all the way into the lungs. Feel the whole path. Your inhalation is very soft and gentle, almost imperceptible. And in your exhalation, just notice how the air comes warm, how it feels in your body when it's coming out of you being present through how your body relaxes and when you're exhaling, naturally relaxes. I surrender. I let go of any attachment, of any image, anything I think I am. 

When I inhale lighting up that inner truth, I'm lighting up my true self with love. So much love, so much gratitude. Every cell of my being takes all that love. Every cell of my being receives that love. So simple, so real. And every exhalation is just an opportunity to release lack of any part. It's not aligned my true self. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I am, I am. I am very gently just staying in this sweet space inside of you. Very gently coming back in your time to open your eyes. Ah, find a nice stretch if you need to always follow your own flow.

====================

LESSON 11: Sustained Synchronicity for an Optimal Flow
--------------------
<v ->Pura vida, familia.</v> Welcome back. In this lesson, we are going to go deeper into synchronicity and how synchronicity is aligned with the flow state. So for now, we've been seeing all the process of Quantum Flow in your life, right? You are grounding; you're connecting with your core; you're releasing; you're expanding. You enter the flow. The flow is the fifth stage of Quantum Flow. It's the flow state. Once you've done all the work, you can allow the flow because it's about allowing it, as we saw before. You don't create it; you don't push it; you allow it. You observe it; you let it dance. Here is where we say we are the dance. We're not the dancer anymore. Have you seen that, the difference, right? When somebody's dancing, and they're trying to look beautiful, and they can look beautiful, but when they're letting the dance flow through them, you're like, whoa! You can't take your eyes away from them, right? It's that amazing, because they have the sparkle. It's like the angels coming through. Well, they are in flow. Same as an athlete, right? Their grace and how they move and what they accomplish; they are in that flow state. The rational mind is not there anymore. They're tranced out. They're hypnotized, right? They are in that deep state of manifestation, of "I am." There's nothing. There's no name. There's no country. There's nothing that matters right now; it's just flowing through, and all we do is witness it. The thing is when you try and when you're pushing and when you're looking for it and when there's expectations and when there's need, that's when we stop it. So this is why we invite you always to come back to your body, be in your breath, be in your body. Go practice your Quantum Flow. Go meditate and observe. Be. Come back to that state. I'm out of alignment; it's okay. No judgment. That's the first step. We don't judge ourselves. It's like wherever I'm at, "Oh, wow; I haven't been present the whole day. Well, thank you, at least I'm present before I'm going to sleep," right? Wherever you're at. "Oh, I haven't been present in the last three days. Oh my god, where have I been?" And it's like, it's okay. Love yourself and come back. When I was going through this phase that I told you, that I fasted for 75 days, do you think I wasn't called to eat all the sugar in the world? Do you think I wasn't called to like stuff myself with all my addictions that I could? Of course, I had that impulse, but was that in my highest? So the moment I had the impulse to eat that chocolate cake, it's like, you know what? "Actually I'm going to fast. I know if I eat sugar right now, I'm going to trigger all these emotions that I can't even deal with right now." I was going through a lot. It's so important, guys, to acknowledge wherever you're at. Don't try to be somewhere you're not. Always love that human part in you. Wherever you're at, be grateful. Wherever you're at in your body, wherever you're at in your life right now, wherever you're at in your mind, going crazy thoughts, emotions, wherever you're at in your relationships, love yourself where you're at. And from there, choose "Is this the highest for me? Am I in flow?" Stop it all and ask. "Okay, I'm open and available. How can I open to deeper layers of flow?" For me what works the most is I move my body. I do the Quantum Flow. I connect. Everything I'm sharing with you guys is for you guys to like okay, "Let me just do that breath. I remember. Let me just go ground. Let me just connect with my muscles a little bit. Let me just hold my breath." As you saw, you can do it anywhere, but you are conscious. You're not staying in that dormant state of no presence. And that is where you start educating yourself. Again, you got to educate your body to come back to that place of like, "Hey, I choose optimum flow. I choose presence. This is my natural state. I'm here to shine. I'm here to be my full potential. All right, this is my choice. This is my mindset, so, okay, I'm out of it." Come back. Come back. Come back. That's the presence. And it's very interesting because when we listen, your body wants to heal. The intelligence of the body wants to come back to its natural state. Look at your body as if it's nature, right? So leave a city 10 years, no humans; nothing happens. Go check that city out in 10, 15 years, whatever the time is. The jungle has come out of it. It's going to destroy everything. Sooner or later, nature will take over. It's its natural state, okay? So you don't have to push; you don't have to try that hard. It's about surrendering to this natural flow. Your body was designed to heal, and your body is the temple of your soul. So when your body's healing, that means your mind is coming back to its natural state; your emotions, your energy, everything comes back to balance. That is the whole path of presence. And coming back to that story, let me tell you when I had those two choices, one, let me fast and really commit to the path I'm in, or let me just go and feed all those addictions and whatever I was going through. I was going through a very, very intense moment in my life. So I chose the path of feeling into it and healing it and going for it fully. When I chose that, I started seeing myself and all these memories from the past started clearing. From when I was a child and the addictions I had with sugar and the addictions I had with sex as a teenager too and in my later years also. Like all the addictions and all the attachments I had that were holding me back were all revealed to me because I wasn't feeding them anymore. I was present. I knew that it was time for me to go to the next level. I knew it. I was committed. I didn't want to keep playing around and putting masks. I was done. It was too much suffering. And sometimes, you need that. Like me, I'm very intense. I need those lessons. I hope you don't. I hope you can learn just by listening to me. I hope you can remember this just like by little lessons and signs that the universe is giving you. The universe is talking to you all the time. The thing is, are we listening? Do we need that big, huge impact to understand and to stop everything and change our lives? Or are we available and open? "Hmm. Let me just breathe right now. Let me just... What's coming through? There's something that's not feeling comfortable right now in my body. What is it? I don't want to move. I don't want to say anything until I really feel into what's going on." That's how precise I am in my life right now. And this came from lessons of like, no, I'm not going to get lost in all these pathways that are just like a dog trying to bite its own tail, right? And you're never going to get to the end of it. It's like, "No, let me face it with love, and let me go deep into it and feel the pain that I haven't been able to feel before." I was running away from my pain. And the most important is, in order to heal, I invite you to feel. I invite you to be present with yourself. Let it come up. Any emotion that comes, any uncomfortability, be present to it. Be open; be available. There's something there for you. There's a message there for you. Instead of drinking the pill and not feeling, right; we're used to that. Let me just anesthetize myself. Or let me just feel it. Let me just listen. What is this trying to tell me? What's coming through me? And once you surrender to this process of healing, it's so beautiful, familia. It's so deep. It's so profound. It's all about surrender and feeling it and not getting lost in the drama. That's being present. I see so many people, and myself included. Wow! Used to get so lost in the drama of it. So something happens, and then it's like I feed that and nurture that suffering pattern. I saw in myself I was addicted to suffering. There was a part of me that loved to be the victim, that loved suffering. Like, if everything went superwell, if everything was amazing, my mind would always look for something to bring it up, especially in a relationship, right? Look how interesting this is, no judgment. Just to observe. When you're present, all these things come up, and you can see from the big picture. You open your wings. I call him the eagle wings. Instead of getting lost in your ego, right? The ego is like self-centered and needing to accomplish and get somewhere, right? It's fully lost in personality, or it could be. Instead of getting lost in the ego, you open up to the eagle, the bird, the eagle that opens its wings, and you become the observer. You're flying; you're thriving. You're not lost anymore in that specific point. You're opened to infinite possibilities. But that happens once you teach yourself to let go, to feel, go deep inside, feel, "Okay, what's coming through right now? Okay, I'm open and receptive. How is this related in my life right now? Why is this coming up right now? Welcome." Breathe it and release it. That's not getting lost in drama. Instead of feeding that. Because we know that pain is inevitable, right? But suffering and staying attached to pain, that's a choice. And I invite you, be very aware of the choices you're making with every breath, with every thought, with every emotion. How aware are you of feeding that pattern? If you're feeding those patterns, that's constricting you, and that's actually pulling you away from the flow, the universal flow. Once you start releasing them, you start working on all this body memory, all the work we're doing with Quantum Flow, releasing, opening up, expanding; then, again, you teach your body to be in that flow state. Your natural state is flow. And we're constantly reminding ourselves to do so. Sometimes is, okay, let me just be silence. Let me breathe. Let me go for a walk. Let me read a book. Let me just be with my family. Let me go to nature. Listen what's that call inside. What feels good, if it's possible to do it in the moment. That is the flow. Sometimes we're pushing so hard to accomplish it, and instead you have to let go of it. Go for a little walk; breathe; take it easy. And then you come back, and it's flowing fully. And that is synchronicity, just following the next step. Once you're acting from that place of your highest self, of what's available to you, then it's like matching. It's all the matching pieces. The right people come at the right time, the right energies, the money, the business, the relationships, all of it. The universe is supporting you all the time. The thing is, when the ego is fighting and it's going against the current, that's when you feel the universe is not supporting. So when you come back, and you're present, and you let go of all those attachments, that's when it flows, and all of a sudden, things, people, energy, money, experiences, everything is there for you at the right time, at the right moment. It's like you plant the seed of your intention, and you just see that the seed has sun and water; take care of it. You can't accelerate the process of the seed. You can be present to it, fully present, give it all the love, but if you go and dig the seed, the seed is going to die. The sun is going to hit the seed before the seed was ready. This is every situation in life. This is every relationship. Every project, every business is the same. Everything has its own process. What we do is be fully present. "Am I really listening? Am I really being present with that person? Am I really feeling them? Am I really being aware of what they are going through right now?" That's how I take this work to my relationships, starting with myself, being raw and real with myself and vulnerable. Then, I can be the same for others. And this is how you can apply all of these principles to every relationship, every business, anything in your life. Anything that you want to focus on right now is based on being present or not. And of course, the same way we apply the principles of synchronicity in our relationship is in everything we do, in everything we are. For example, I was coming to film this morning, and I was like fully in like, okay, following what we're sharing and what we're going to cover and everything from within. Like I love really feeling what I want to share with you guys. For me, it's very important going over it, like tune into that. It's coming from the deepest of my being. And I was kind of not being present with the team, with the family here that's helping me, supporting me on this mission, right? To film and everything. And one of them, it's a beautiful mama with a beautiful baby in her belly, Mattias. And I wasn't aware of that until I felt to stop in the moment and breathe. I opened my eyes; I looked to my side, and she was coming, walking through the door in that moment. And I was like, "Oh, oh, wait a second. Can I feel you a second?" And I connected with her, and I connected with the baby, and I received a lot of the information of how important it was for me to share the story in a certain way with you guys. And I saw everything come through, through the baby. It was like a message came through. So it was the same story, everything I knew, but a different approach. Something happened in me; something shifted that I can't even explain. I let it be; I listened. I wasn't fixated on I need to cover one, two, three, four, five, six. Let me be aware what's going on. Let me open my eyes. I look, and there's a message for me, and I received it. It was such a gift. We had the most powerful moment right before starting the filming day. And that's what invited us, not only me, us, the whole team, to be in more synchronicity, to be in that vibration, all connected, all present with each other, listening and knowing that there's a universal pulsation going beyond our personalities. Synchronicity is the flow of life. I want to invite you to go into this beautiful flow, to go deeper into your flow state. I'm going to do a Quantum Flow activation. And now that you understand a little more how this applies to your life, not only in the activation, 'cause everything we're doing there, it's for you to go and bring it to your life, to your lifestyle. It's a way of living. You live in synchronicity, and you teach your body how to access that synchronicity in the body. So when I invite you to dance, go for it. Celebrate life. Feel the gratitude for your body, for your self, for your life, where it's right now. It's perfect where it's right now. And at the same time, celebrate what you're calling in. The more present you are, the more you're calling in that life of your dreams. It's happening now. And this is what we do with Quantum Flow. We're just letting our body, our mind, our emotions know that we're aligned with our soul, that we're choosing the flow state, that this is a way of life, until your body just does it naturally. It's like, okay, I'm in flow. That's it. Next, call that person. Read that book. Listen to your intuition. What is going on? The next step. It happens naturally. You don't even think about it. You trust. You trust that voice that's in your gut. It feels, you can feel it, what's right. You can feel it when it's like, a no. And you follow that. You learn to listen, to trust, and to act from that inner voice, from that inner feeling, that inner gut that resonates inside of you. That's why we do the practice. Through Quantum Flow, we connect with that more and more until you have it so clear. When it's a complete yes and when it's a complete no. And through this practice, I also invite you to always journal around it. What comes up for you? What did you let go of? What are you opening up to? Always have a journal with you because a lot of ideas, a lot is going to be coming through you, always available and receptive, right? All right, familia. Thank you all so much for your presence again. I can't wait to share with you more about the science behind the energetic systems. What is really going on behind the nervous system that is reflecting onto the chakras, onto your electromagnetic field, and how we can synchronize that in order to live in more flow. This is our next lesson, and we'll see you very soon.

====================

LESSON 12: The Science Behind Your Energetic Systems
--------------------
<v ->Familia linda, welcome back.</v> My beautiful family, thank you for being here. Thank you for doing this beautiful work of transformation, of presence. Today we're going deeper into the energetic system and the science behind the chakras and how that relates to our life. What's most important is understanding how we bring this to our daily life because we can talk about so much out there; it's so beautiful; it's so good to know all this philosophy, and how do we apply it to our daily life. That's what this is all about. We're playing here; we're flowing with this energy and flowing with this philosophy, mindset, embodiment, all of it, all of it together; that's what life is. It's this intertwining all these energies into our life. So today I want to invite you to go deeper into what is energy? And how is energy emanated in life, in our bodies? How is that related to our nervous system? It's not just something out there, something woo woo; it's something I can actually feel; I can actually see; I can actually take a photo of; we can measure energy in your body right now; we have all the science to measure at least a little bit of the percentage of this energy. And when we look at the human body and the nervous system, we see that there are seven nervous plexuses. That is agglomeration of nerves; accumulation, deep, deep accumulation of nerves in specific parts of the body. And these specific parts are related to endocrine glands and are related to, of course, what we call the chakras, the emanation of energy that comes from the nervous system. And when the nervous system is relaxed and has been unraveled and is in flow, the energy's emanating all around you. It's reflected not only in your energy field, but it's reflected in your life. So going over the stages and now relating them to these nervous plexuses will help us go even deeper and understand and just see ourselves, so we can open even more into presence, into our full potential. As we saw before, step number one is grounding. You are grounded; you are connected; you are in your body; you are feeling your body; you are listening to your body, and the messages your body is telling you. Your body speaks to you. And we relate to the body through this nervous plexus of the pelvic floor. We have been working with the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor is what brings you alive and awake. It's like your sexual energy. It's like your spirit of, like, survival, being alive and awake, which is really good; survival is not bad; the problem is we live most in survival mode. Survival is amazing, feeling like an animal, feeling that strength and that presence and that whoa focus of an animal that's hunting for example. It's such a beautiful energy to cultivate. You're fully in your body, and this is actually the energy we're cultivating for being the spiritual warrior. Always observing thoughts, emotions, what's happening. I'm not asleep anymore; I'm not a zombie. I wake up; I'm present. I don't tolerate that thought anymore; I don't tolerate that emotion; I don't tolerate these people around me anymore. I choose to live connected, aligned with my highest self. This comes from that first chakra, that first connection to your innate intelligence of the body. And when we haven't rewired that part of your nervous system, what happens is you don't feel safe. You don't open up to other people, to new relationships, to new projects; there's something holding you back; it's almost like you don't feel you belong to this earth. I lived like that for a long time. I was flying here in these chakras always like my intuition and feeling and visualizing and dreaming, and I wasn't in my body. My dream started manifesting when I got deep into my body to feel everything I had to feel, to be everything I was here to be. And this starts with the pelvic floor, and all the activation, all the movement, all the permeability we're creating in your pelvic floor; the energy has been stuck; it has been like ravelled up like a knot, and now we're opening it up, and now we're opening that connection with the earth and acknowledging that our body is the earth and that we're a beautiful reflection of the earth, every element is inside of us. The same minerals that mother earth has is inside our body; we are just an extension of the earth. We are like a cell in this big body that is the earth. And once you start opening up to this first chakra, you start feeling it. Once you start opening up to this innate intelligence, you feel it; you go to nature, and it's like full connection. You nurture yourself; there's no separation. And it's not a separation I'm talking about, "Oh, I see we're all one and one light." No, you feel it. You look at a tree, and it's like, that's you. You look at a flower, and it's like, that's you. It's oneness at a gut feeling; this comes once you really have opened that, and really have cleared that. So you feel at home; earth is your home; the whole planet is your home, and home starts with your body. And the feeling of home starts by being safe, letting your nervous system know that you're safe, that you can open, that you can relax, that you are amazing just the way you are, that you love being in a body, you love having a body; "I am a soul with a body; this is amazing! Oh my God, I am energy in a body; What?" You acknowledge that, and you open up to the magic of life. It's so magical. First step from there, everything else will be different because you're living from a place of magic. You're living from a place of gratitude. Life is a miracle by itself. Even if I don't do anything, even if just I'm sitting down here, even if I'm just not even have any plan in my head, life is perfect; whoa, that is the vibration of nature, and that's what we're cultivating through this practice of presence is, once you're in that presence, now once you're clear raw and real with who you are and what are you letting go of, you're ready for the next step. Bring on the alchemy; bring on the transformation. I'm ready to burn anything that's not aligned with my highest self, even if I don't know what my blind spots are. I'm open and available. And this purification starts in this chakra here, then it goes to the belly, to all the organs and everything, but it opens up here; it opens up through the expression. That's why I'm always inviting you to do a sound, to release, to let go, because if you open the throat and you let go of all the restrictions that are here, that is going to open so much of your inner expression and of your releasing whatever has hold you back. Many of us have lived with the fear of expressing our truth because it creates conflict, because it's going to create a problem, because I'm not going to feel good, somebody else is going to get hurt, doesn't matter why, but all these beliefs are inside, and if we don't release them, we're holding back. So we welcome the alchemy through your throat; it starts here, bringing the tongue out, letting it flow, doing the sound, whatever flows; everything we're doing in Quantum Flow, it's helping you open up to that divine expression that's within you. Once you've cleared the throat of course, and it's opening up more and more, then you go deep into the organs, and that's when you start working with like all the wounds and microtraumas and whatever there is there; it doesn't even matter. We are holding all these emotions that have been crystallized, not only in the nervous system but in the organs. Your organs are antennas, and they carry all of this from your past, so the more we release them and go into this alchemy, the more everything is going to be released from the core out. And yes, the alchemy is very important, but the most important is to be present to yourself every time with every breath. What are you feeling? It's either no, or is it a yes. You start following that intuition; that is your flow. Sometimes you meet someone, and it's like, "Oh, I feel something weird, but they look nice, and they have beautiful clothes," and they're so nice with you, and then after a while you find out who they are. You knew it from the beginning, is that inner gut feeling you know; start nurturing that even more, like your capacity to say yes and your capacity to say no; that comes from here. So that's going to help you release, and that's going to help you empower yourself. Empowerment comes from this nervous plexus here, and then we go deep into the core; that's when we are going into the passion, the fire. This is very important to release all the nervous plexus around the naval. This is related to the sexual energy that's coming through your body; this is where like your soul says, "I am here; this is me with all my gifts, with all my creativity; this is me sharing my light. I'm not afraid of my light anymore, I'm holding the space I deserve. That's my natural state." Sometimes we're playing small, and it's like not letting that presence in your body, and this happens in your core. All the nervous plexus around your naval need to be opened, need to be, ah, relaxed, in order for you to sink. Let the soul sink in your body and just be; allow it to shine, and trust that you will attract and be surrounded by the people that can hold that light, that want to be around that light, that is going to be nurtured by that light, not judging it, not comparing themselves, not that vibration anymore; you're cultivating that vibration of presence, and that radiates outside, and it brings people that are in the same vibration as you. So your light, your flow, comes from here, from the core. And when we have the solar plexus, and all the nerves that are related to it in a knot, what happens is like we stay in the first three chakras; the energy's not going into the heart. There's no expansion; it's like contraction; it's like living in scarcity. No matter how much money you have, how much ideas, how many businesses you have, how many relationships, it doesn't matter anything outside of you; there's a part of you that's still in scarcity. There's that part of your nervous system that is wiring you to stay lost, still in the ego, in the accomplishments, in like, "This is me, and I have to prove myself." It's still playing in that little me, because compared to the universal me, it's nothing. So the more we release all that tension in these parts of the nervous system, the more you're going to open up to your real power. It's universal power; it's not your personal power anymore. You open up to universal power, and universal power guides you, and that's where your vibrating in the heart. Once we start opening all this nervous plexus that's all around your chest, all around the ribs, what happens every time we've been hurt, we close ourselves. That's why this is the typical attitude of like, "I'm protecting myself; don't come close," but I'm closing myself from all the opportunities, from life energy, so what we're doing with the breath and everything we are embodying right now, you are opening up; you're letting your body know that there is space, that you are safe, that your heart is open, that the space between the ribs can open up, and the space between every one of the discs in your spine is going to open; you're going to create space. It happens in your body that's reflected in your life. Then you're living your life from love. Once we have rewired those parts of the nervous system, you are aligned to love; you are love. It's not anymore looking for love. It's not anymore trying to be love. It's not anymore trying to be loved. It's "I am love, that's who I am, it's my birthright. That's my presence," boom! And that love is emanated all around you. And that love is felt; if you're calling the partner of your dreams, I can tell you that's going to call it more than ever, more than the look, more than the dress. That's amazing, that's just a reflection of your inner love. But if that inner love is not there, then you're going to be calling someone also that is not connected with their inner love, and that's the co-dependency, that's when we go into all these dramas of co-dependency because we don't have powerful pillars: I am; I am, and there's a third pillar, I am which is the relationship. Two powerful pillars of presence, and the third one is the relationship. This comes from the heart; the heart is the connection, not the naval. That's why we're resetting all the nervous system because at the naval we were stuck; we could be stuck with our mother and our dependency with someone else; it's something that's innate, and if we don't rewire it, no matter how much mindset you have, you're always going to come back to something related to a trauma with the mother, with a relationship, that's still holding you back; that's not the real power, the true power, the true presence. True presence is freedom. And freedom comes from the heart. Once we have released all that trauma, all that tension all around every one of the ribs; that's why we inhale, and we sip it in; we open space. Everything has a reason; everything we're sharing with you has a reason because you want to open more space, more space to create, more space to expand, more space to be; that is the language of the heart; 528 hertz, it's a vibration, and you can choose it through your body, and everything we're doing right now. I invite you to feel it right now; breathe in to your heart; aah, let's share that heart space together. Aah, relax into it; it's so beautiful; it's so simple. Aah, allow your heart to expand all around you, and close your eyes or not; just be. Be the heart, be the love. Just relax yourself into it. Breathing into the heart, breathing into the center of the chest, if there's any tension right there, breathe into it; be the master of your temple, and release that tension through your breath. Wherever it's not flowing, breathe. Bring the flow through your breath; bring the flow; invite the flow through your breath. Very subtle, very gentle, loving breathe. Ah, a little sound; let that sound soothe you. Just the blessing of stopping and being present for the heart. 'Cause through my heart I'm connecting with the universal heart, the universal pulsation. And that's the flow; that's the synchronicity. The doorway is your heart. Beautiful, very gently coming back. So it's part of life; we take a moment to breathe; we take a moment to stop; we take a moment to just be present with ourselves, what's going on. And when we stop, we can be more receptive to our intuition. And this is when we go into the pineal gland, the pituitary gland, the brain, the whole brain, rewiring the brain. When I'm so open and receptive to the universe, the inner verse, it's inside of me. But if I keep all that tension around my scalp, my jaw, my neck, the energy's not going to flow into my brain; it's very simple. When there's tension, there's no flow. That's why we release tension constantly, different approaches to release, to open up, to let your body know that it's safe, to let your brain know that it can take space. Your brain is a muscle, and it's usually tense, so what we're doing with this practice is relaxing it like gelatin, just with that; feel it how it expands, take it's space in your head right now; let it sink. Aah, how good does that feel? Just by being aware of it, are you carrying any tension there? Just be aware of it. And this is so important 'cause it's our connection with our divine self, our highest self, our intuition, our inner calling. Every step of the way we can be guided naturally. It's not about thinking about it, trying, and waiting for a response; it becomes your natural state, and all of a sudden you're just there following that, and that's when synchronicity happens, because your whole nervous system is in flow; your whole nervous system is in full permeability. There's no tension; there's no body armor that separating the outer with the inner 'cause there's no separation, but the nervous system can create that. So what we're doing is we are releasing; we are making it permeable for you to be in that flow, for you to be in that pulsation, for you to just embody that presence of "I am" at a cellular level. So your nervous system becomes the battery of each one of the chakras; it's what lights up the chakras; the chakras are like light bulbs, and if they're all shining bright, each one at its own color, at its own frequency, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful rainbow colors all around you. It's an emanation of energy all around you. This is the electromagnetic frequency you are emanating to attract people, things, energies, experiences, everything that's aligned to you; this is synchronicity; it happens from within. This is Ultra Presense. And of course, the more we go into these activations and start expanding ourselves from within, the more we can journal about this, and just see, observe everything that we have talked about today. What does it move you? I invite you to journal and just look at yourself raw and real, and where do you feel your connection is with each one of the chakras, everything we talked about; how does that relate to you? I would love to hear from you; it would be amazing if you can share just your thoughts, your feelings, whatever's coming through for you in the group. It's so good to hear you all just sharing and being human, really amazing. Thank you so much for staying with me, for being present, and honoring yourself in this path. I'm so grateful to share this with you. And I can't wait to share more about biohacking your energetic system, going deeper into this process; that is our next lesson. We'll see you soon.

====================

LESSON 12: Meditation - Expand Your Energetic Systems

Ah, relax into it. It's so beautiful. It's so simple. Ah, allow your heart to expand all around you and close your eyes or not. Just, just be, be the heart. Be the love. Just relax yourself into it. Breathing into the heart, breathing into the center of the chest. If there's any tension right there, breathe into it. Be the master of your temple, and release that tension through your breath. Wherever it's not flowing, breathe. Bring the flow through your breath. Bring the flow, invite the flow through your breath. Very subtle, very gentle, loving breath. Ah, a little sound that that sound soothe you. Just the blessing of stopping and being present for the heart, because through my heart I'm connecting with the universal heart, the universal pulsation. And that's the flow, that's the synchronicity. The doorway is your heart. Hmm. Beautiful. Very gently coming back. Hmm. So it's, it's part of life. We take a moment to breathe. We take a moment to stop. We take a moment to, to just be present with ourselves.

====================

LESSON 13: Biohack & Upgrade Your Energetic Systems
--------------------
<v ->Pura vida, familia. Welcome back.</v> You know, pura vida means pure life, and it's a Costa Rican Tico saying that we hear it everywhere when you come, and it's, when you analyze it, it's really about living life at its maximum state which is pure presence. When you're present, you're pura vida; you're pure life; life is flowing through you. So I invite you to just reflect on that and allow that concept of pura vida to be your lifestyle; why not? So yesterday we talked about the nervous system, the energetic system, and how that's related to manifestation, how's that related to presence. Of course, it's all about presence coming from within. Today we're going to focus more around how do we biohack the nervous system? How do we biohack for the energy to flow better, to be more present in our life? So you have been doing it already. You have been practicing it with me; you have it in your body, but I want to explain it to you, so you can go even deeper into the methodology of Quantum Flow. As you know, energy is always flowing up and down through your spine. If you're alive, you have energy, electricity flowing through your spine; that's why you're alive. So this energy is the connection between earth and heaven. This energy is electricity: positive, negative; masculine, feminine; however you want to call that; we are definitely a magnet. And if this magnet is balanced, the electromagnetic field is fully expanded. So how do we balance that inner magnet? Through this methodology, we are going to each one of the nervous plexuses, and in this nervous plexus we are moving the energy in a spiral way. So through the nervous system, that's related to the chakras, which are vortexes of energy that move in spirals. Yes, there's like cones, vortices. Chakra means wheel, but it's more than a wheel. It's not a flat wheel, it's like a tunnel of energy that is emanating all around you. And when we learn how to move those energies and help them spin faster, that's when you start feeling more present, more alive, more into your purpose; why not? So in this methodology, as you already know, we start with grounding; we start with the body; we start with the pelvic floor as the energy of life, energy of life flowing through us. Then instead of going to the second chakra, which is the sexual chakra, we go up into the throat; we purify; we release; we release from here. So when you open the nervous plexus of the throat, you are opening up the energy to clearly go deeper into the organs and release even more organs and everything we're carrying around the core. The core is the power of our being, but it's been so distorted; it's been so disconnected. So in order to go deeper we're releasing first the alchemy. We are going into the alchemy, which is the throat; that's why the throat is so important. Then after that, the doorway opens into the belly. We can go deeper; we can release even more; like deeper emotions come up. We have more access to the body memory, and that's why we go into what we call the core. You're working there with the naval, all around the naval, deep, deep inside, in the solar plexus too. From there we take it to the heart, so the heart expands; the heart opens up; the heart radiates. From the heart, it goes down to the second chakra. The second chakra is this sexual energy that's arising, but it's already clear. You see, we're not going one, two, three, four, five, six, seven; that's always happening in your body, as I said before. But when you're biohacking the nervous system and letting the body know that there is a different way to work on it, you accelerate that capacity of your body, first of all to release, and then to refine itself and be more connected faster with that energy that's available to you. How amazing is that? So, of course, you open up once you liberate yourself; everything you're carrying on the back of your head, your neck, your shoulders, your jaw, all of that, you're allowing everything you've carried here, all the emotions, to release even deeper. You're accelerating the work; then it goes into the heart. Then it goes down into the base, like right behind the sacrum. We're working all around that zone. That is the pure sexual energy. That is the flow; that is the water. Now the water comes through; now you're flowing, but what happened? You released; you opened up; you took it into the heart; you opened up to love. Now you are connected to unattached love. And when you enter and you do all the work we're doing with Quantum Flow all around the belly and all around the second chakra, the energy's already refined, so what's happening? You're working with pure energy of manifestation, pure energy of presence, pure energy of creativity. It's not distorted; it's not sexuality getting in the way. And this is why many gurus, you can see, and you've seen all over the world, fall down and come down from their pedestal, through the sexual energy. I got lost myself in sexual energy. I went through that; I know what that is. And this is why also I love this system, and I opened up to a different way to approach it, where you're still working with Kundalini energy, but you're letting your body know there's a different approach; there's a different way. You're inviting the energy to flow differently, so we can release faster. The more you release, the more you're in that present, the presence of being. Of course we love sexual energy, of course energy of manifestation. But let's work with it clearly, opened, refined, crystal clear, going up into your pineal gland. So after we're stimulating all that zone around the sacrum, your gut is directly connected to your brain. It's your second brain actually. So once you get the signal of this refined, pure crystal energy being cultivated, energy of manifestation going right into your pineal gland, you're cleared; you are relaxed. The energy is going right into the thalamus gate, opening up the central callos, the callos that separates the left and right side of the brain. They reconnect; we start electrifying them; we start waking them up and reminding them that we are whole, that we are one. That there is no separation between feminine and masculine, rationality and intuition; it's all the same. And in the balance, there is Ultra Presence. Ultra Presence is balance in every part, every cell of your being. So now we have accessed dormant parts of the brain; we have accessed a different way to approach the pineal gland, the pituitary gland. Everything is being rewired in the brain. Poof, we open up to infinite possibilities. We open up the crown; we open up the "I am;" we open up the inner silence, the wholeness. It's always been there for us. The thing is, we have been so clenched in our own little world of the past that we are not yet available to it. So this biohacking spiral opens up the way to just accelerate the process of ascension, accelerate the process of expansion, accelerate the process of being fully present in your body. And of course, if you're like me and you've done yoga all your life, and you know all the theories around the chakras and the Kundalini energy and Ida and Pingala and all these philosophies which are amazing, know that is still happening. We're not going against that. We're just accelerating that process of expansion, of awakening, of remembering. All we're doing is we're opening up our channel. We are a channel of energy. How much do you want to receive? How much are you open to receive? So through the nervous system, we're opening our capacity to receive electricity, energy, which is love, money, all of it. It's all energy at the end. How much electricity can you hold in your nervous system? It's related to every area of your life. So of course, time to put it into action; time to bring it in the body. All this mindset, all this philosophy, it's nothing if we don't feel it. We're going to go deep into the Quantum Flow methodology now for you to feel even more presence in your body and to understand a little more what's going on through your body. And before we go, I want to invite you to journal a little bit about this. What beliefs is this triggering on you? This way of going in spirals and opening the nervous system in a different way. Is this moving something in you? Do you have any questions? Do you have anything you want to share? We'd love to hear from you. We are here for you. Please share in the community; share in the group. We want to hear from you and any question you have; know that I love going deep into all of it. All right, familia. So let's bring all this into practice, into our daily life. We will see you in the Quantum Flow activation, and get ready for the next lesson which is about waking up the pineal gland and how to expand our intuition; see you soon.

====================

LESSON 13: Quantum Flow - Purify Your Kundalini Force
--------------------
<v ->Hola; hola, familia. Here we go deeper</v> and deeper into your Quantum Flow activation. Today we're going to see the spiral that's created, and I'm going to explain which stage we're going through just for you to be aware in your body. We've been doing it, but now you're more aware of what's going on and what nervous plexus you're, you're working through. So I invite you to do this sitting down. The first part at least, or standing up, whatever feels good for you. Please always respect wherever you're at. Take your time to just tune into your breath. You can bring your hands to your belly or one hand on your heart, the other in the belly. Whatever feels good for you. Both hands in the heart. Just be aware of your breath. Be aware of your posture. Be aware of your thoughts, your emotions, sensations in your body. It's all welcome. I am the observer. I am presence. Connect with your intention. Opening up to deeper layers of presence. Where do you want to focus that into your life? Connect with that intention. Allow yourself to feel into it as it's already done. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Breathe into your intention; nurture your intention. Thank you; thank you; thank you. "I am open and receptive to accelerate the process of manifestation through biohacking my nervous system." Thank you; thank you; thank you. And so it is. Whenever you're ready, take a deep breath and exhale. Relax, down to the earth. Down to the earth, ah. Find a nice stretch there. If you're sitting down, also just, allow yourself to hang towards the earth. If you're standing up, bend your knees, and just allow yourself to have sweet breath. "I surrender. I release. I let go." Thank you; thank you; thank you. Then very gently, whenever you're ready, very gently come back, opening up to the sky, to the sun, to the light that you are. Expand your arms. Relax your shoulders. Find a nice stretch. And this time, bring your hands towards your elbows. Grasp your elbows with your hands. Shoulders back. Allow your shoulders to relax, back away from your ears; can move your head from side to side. Opening your throat. Find that sweet flow inside of you, opening space in your body for more presence. Coming back to center. Open your eyes; bend your knees. Now opening up to the sun, to the stars. Inhale, shoulders back, elbows back, and exhale. Bend your knees; ground. Bring the elbows forward a little bit. Inhale, again you can do this sitting down perfectly well if that feels good for you. Or whenever you want to stand up, you can stand up. Very gentle breath. Opening all the sides of your chest, of your ribs. And opening your heart to the sun. Remembering the sun is inside of you. And this last one, hold it, shoulders back; relax. Zip it in. Open it up. Elbows back. Allow yourself to stretch and then relax. Ah. <v ->Just feel it.</v> <v ->Beautiful.</v> <v ->Okay, going into</v> the grounding, first stage of Quantum Flow. So here the hands interlace, one with the other. Bend your knees. And we're just going to go into the pelvic floor activation. Remember? So inhaling, exhale; activate pelvic floor, navel in; tuck in your tailbone. And your hands, Push one towards the other, very gently. Very gently, just to remind you to activate your pelvic floor. Inhale; open your hips, shoulders back; open your throat, and then exhale. Activate pelvic floor. Stretch just enough to feel all your muscles connected to your pelvic floor. So inhaling, the hips open back; you look up; bend your knees; bend your elbows, exhaling. Again, you can still do this sitting down. Same movement. You're working with the spine. That's what's important. You open up the hips; you open the chest when you inhale, and when you exhale, you activate your pelvic floor. Wake up that grounding energy in your body. Inhaling, shoulders back; open your hips; look up, exhaling. Activate the pelvic floor, and stay there. Exhale all the air out, and activate that pelvic floor. Keep it active. No inhalation. Keep it active. Now inhale; keep the pelvic floor active, and open the arms to the sides. Keep the pelvic floor active. Yes, it's going to be a little uncomfortable. And hold the inhalation, and keep the pelvic floor active. That's it. And now exhale; relax. If you're sitting down, you can come forward a little bit. Yeah. Again, inhale, and pelvic floor active, squeeze. Hold it; hold it right there. You're floating. Full pelvic floor action. Exhale. Ah, one more. Well done. Inhaling. Go deep into that nervous plexus right there. Tailbone in. Activate pelvic floor. Beautiful. Relax. Open sweet. Exhale. Ah, nice. Now all that energy, we open into alchemy. So alchemy starts in the neck. So the hands face the throat, right in the center of the throat. This is where alchemy begins. Yes. You can microbend your knees if you are standing up; if not sitting down is perfect. Just relax your shoulders. Yeah. Now you want to move your head. One side, inhale center, and the other side. Yeah, you want to open space in your throat. And then biophotonic breath, whenever you're ready. <v ->Shh,</v> <v ->shh,</v> <v ->shh</v> <v ->You can take it slower. Shh.</v> Whatever works for you. Shh. <v ->Shh. Open it up. Shh. Shh.</v> <v ->Shh. Couple more. Shh. Shh.</v> <v ->And this time, stay;</v> stay there. No inhalation. Find a nice stretch. Inhale back to center. Relax your shoulders. Chin in. Navel in. Bring that energy into your throat. Exhale to the other side. Stay there. No inhalation. Stay there. Inner smile into your throat, inhale center, chin in, navel in, pelvic floor active. And now open the throat. That's it. Inhale, hands to the throat. Now bring your tongue out. Open up. That releases the throat, the neck. Hahhhhh. Really good to release tension, huh? The lion's breath. Hahhhh. Hahhhh. Nice, inhale. Hold it, and exhale. Open it up sweetly. <v ->Ah</v> <v ->Yes. Allowing the energy to flow.</v> Now you have opened the channel of purification. Very well done. Okay, you, you can bring your hands to your thighs. Again, you can be sitting down right now or standing. Inhale and exhale through your mouth. Now you go deeper into alchemy. The navel goes in when you exhale. You have released your throat. And now it's easier to let it go. Now you're exhaling. Remember through your core, navel in; exhale through your mouth, navel in; release. Inhale; open your heart. Open your chest. Look up. So you see, you're still working on your throat; you're still working on your neck. Full release. Go faster. <v ->One more.</v> Inhale. Hold it. Bring your hands to your throat. Zip it in. Exhaling. Expand that energy all around you. Ah. After releasing that tension from your neck, expand it all around you. "I speak my truth from my heart. I feel into my gut. I trust that inner voice. What feels right. And I say yes when its a yes. <v ->And I say no, when it's a no.</v> I respect myself. I love myself. I listen to that voice and I express it with love." Thank you; thank you; thank you. Visualize that throat full of light, forgiving yourself for all the times you've said no or yes when you weren't feeling it. Open now to that inner truth. <v ->Thank you.</v> Beautiful. <v ->Now let's go into the core.</v> This one, the navel's going to go in deeper, and you're going to bring the hands back like this. Inhaling forward and exhaling, navel in. Inhaling, exhaling. Remember core, clearing. Yes, three more. <v ->Let's do a couple of ha's.</v> When you inhale; exhale. <v ->Ha!</v> <v ->Ha!</v> Feel your core. Feel your power. Feel your strength. That's it. Inhale; open up. Hold it. Open up. Bring it to your heart. Expand it; zip it in, and release. Ah, thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. Again, let's work on that solar plexus and bring that energy to the heart. Inhaling, exhaling, activate your core, and then inhale. Open it to the heart; expand it, and release. <v ->Ah</v> <v ->From the core into the heart.</v> Take a deep inhalation; zip it in. Tap the center of your chest right there. Tap it. Tap it. You can even tap it with your fists. Wake it up. Wake up the energy. Wake up that nervous plexus right there. Yes. And expand. <v ->Ah,</v> yes. <v ->Now we're going to do the same.</v> We're going to zip it in, and that's going to work on that nervous plexus of your heart. Inhale, hold it; zip it in. Tap into it. That's good. And expand it. Allow that radiancy to expand all around you. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. <v ->Nice.</v> <v ->Whew.</v> <v ->And now going into the flow.</v> Hands in your belly, breathing deep into the belly, expanding that all around the second chakra, holding it, expanding it right there, big Buddha Belly. And then release that nervous plexus. <v ->Ah.</v> <v ->Release that energy all around you.</v> Couple more. Inhale. Hold it; zip it in, and release. Again, visualize, feel, or know you're expanding the light through the belly, from the navel, from the pubic bone, all around you. <v ->Beautiful.</v> <v ->That is the flow.</v> That is the movement that happens. The watery water element flowing through you. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->And now we bring it up into the brain.</v> So hands together, inhale all the way up into the brain. Squeeze, navel and pelvic floor active. Squeeze into the brain. Yes. Create that pressure right there into the brain. Wake up the pineal gland, and open it up. Allow it to open. Beautiful. From that second chakra in front of that pubic bone. Bring it all the way up. Inhaling. Squeeze. Squeeze. Relax your jaw; relax your neck, and open it up. "I am presence." <v ->Ah.</v> <v ->Allowing presence to permeate every cell of your being.</v> One more, inhaling. Hold it. Squeeze. <v ->Expand it all around you.</v> Beautiful. Mmm. Relax your shoulders. Relax your arms. Close your eyes, that feeling into that pulsation. Allowing your whole body to glow from within. And bring your attention to your crown. Breathe into your crown. Focus your mind on your crown. And all the energy you've cultivated now goes to the crown. Very gently relax your shoulders, your neck, your jaw. Breathing into the crown, inhaling. When you exhale, the crown shines. The whole brain shines and expands that inner glow all around you. Inhaling into the brain, into the crown, and allowing that to expand all around you. "I am presence. I am." The seventh stage of Quantum Flow. "Divine truth, I am. I am light." Just staying in this vibration, this frequency, very gently coming back, full of gratitude. Very gently coming back. Bring your hands to your heart. Hmm. Beautiful work guys. Very simple Quantum Flow activation. Just to understand how we're working deeply on the nervous system. The nervous plexuses are unraveling, guys. This is how we do it. <v ->Thank you so much.</v> If you tried this sitting down, I recommend you try it standing up, anytime, any day, and vice versa. Try both because it's doable both ways, and it's very different one from the other. Thank you all so much. We'll see you soon.

====================

LESSON 14: Awaken Your Pineal Gland & Expand Your Intuition
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, familia.</v> Today, we are going to talk about deeper states of consciousness and how your presence, Ultra Presence, is related to you being able to receive all these subtle messages that are always available. Codes, frequencies, ideas, anything that's related to creativity, to your inner genius, it's related to your capacity to capture this, to receive this, because they're always there. It's like the ideas are always floating in space, but are we able to receive them? Are we open and receptive? This is using the body as a channel, as an antenna of receptivity, and in the body, going right into the brain. We have been set for survival. So the amygdala, the hippocampus, all the glands in your brain. Because of all the trauma we've lived, because of our past, they're all been set for survival mode. This means like your brain is always waiting for something to happen, okay? Always keeping you safe. It's like there's danger all around. It's something very subtle, very deep. But if there's danger all around, how can I open myself to the subtleness of life, to all these subtle dimensions? This happens when I am relaxed, when I feel safe, when I feel centered and grounded, when my whole nervous system is like, "Ah, okay, thank you so much." I can open up like a flower. So your pineal gland is actually like a flower that receives the sun, that receives the energy from the stars. As we said before, it's like a crystal. It's got like macro crystals, 'cause you can only see 'em with a very, very, very profound microscope. But it is all made up of crystals. And the way to wake up these crystals is through this pressure we're creating on the abdominals. We're moving the energy of survival from your lower chakras going all the way up into the brain and waking up, stirring up. That's why we hold the breath. That's why we activate the abdominals. That's why we push our limits a little bit, just enough, really feeling what is your rhythm? Because if you create too much tension, then again, you're falling into the same hole of tension means. So if we don't work with the pineal gland in an intelligent way, you can actually create more tension. So it's about activation contraction and relaxation expansion. That is what we do with Quantum Flow. That is what's going to bring that presence, that ability to capture all the codes, all the frequencies, all the ideas that's available to you right now. And as we said before, the pineal gland has been calcified. The pineal gland is like surrounded by this egg of, actually, calcium. And this calcium has a lot of chemicals that we have taken since we're born. This can be pollution from food, from the air we breathe, from the water. It doesn't matter. Humanity's lifestyle today has all these substances, all these chemicals, that actually accumulate in different parts of the body. And one of the parts is the pineal gland, the brain, but specifically the pineal gland. So what we're doing with this work is moving, releasing, letting go, cracking that egg open, so you can open up to the vision, intuition, that connection directly to source, to your highest self, through your pineal gland. And of course, everything we've done through this whole process. So today, I want to focus more on the practice, on the experience. We're going to go deep to awaken the pineal gland through the heels. The heels are connected to your nervous system, through your spine that goes all the way up into your brain. We're going to open space through the body for the pineal gland and the brain to release all the tension and you can go deeper into a meditation. No expectation. Just allowing yourself to go into it. Trust the process, and enjoy the ride. Thank you so much for trusting the process, for going deep and surrendering to this beautiful awakening of Ultra Presence. In our next lessons, we're going to wrap it all up. This is the most important part, because it's about integration and how we can apply this to our daily life. Can't wait to share that with you all. See you very soon.

LESSON 14: Meditation - Awaken Your Pineal Gland & Expand Your Intuition

<silence> Very gently when I invite you to sit down comfortably can be on a pillow, on the floor or on a chair. Ever feels good for you. Take your time and sit down. Perfect. Perfecto. So once you've found your comfortable sitting position, whatever that is for you, finding that posture again and sweet breath, inhaling very sweetly through your nose. Exhaling through your nose, inhaling, exhaling. Allow your face to relax. Your neck, your shoulders, your jaw. Everything's relaxed. Now that the channel is open, it's all about surrendering to the breath. Keep breathing soft and gentle, allowing your sympathetic nervous system to calm down. 

Do three more breaths and we're gonna hold on the exhalation, which invites your parasympathetic nervous system in so you can relax more. One more breath, then exhale all the air out and just stay there. No inhalation. You're holding the exhalation. Relax. If your body wants to get tense a little bit, just relax into it. Be fully present with yourself. And whenever you feel cold to breathe, wait a little bit and then breathe very gently. You don't have to push it. It's very lovingly. You inhale deep and then you hold the inhalation and staying relaxed. Get your navel in your pelvic floor active. Activate the energy, okay, into your brain, and then exhale and relax. That's it. Just do one more, very gentle inhalation, exhalation through your nose and close your eyes. Very gentle, sweet, loving bread. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for this journey. 

Keep breathing soft and gentle. There's any tension in your body. Be aware of it, and relax it. Always in gratitude, allowing gratitude to permeate every cell of your being. Let's do three more, and whenever you're ready, exhaling all the air out and staying there. Allow your nervous system to rewire. It's okay to feel a little uncomfortable. Relax into it. Teach your body that it's okay to sometimes be uncomfortable, being comfortable in the uncomfortable. Just surrendering to that. Whenever you have that first impulse to breathe, hold it a little more. Stay relaxed. Whenever you're ready, following your own rhythm, take a sweet inhalation, hold it, and then squeeze que in the energy from the pelvic floor, from the navel. Hold the intrinsic muscles of the abdominal pushing. Stay relaxed. Joy is relaxed. Make us relaxed. Keep pushing, keep squeezing, and then exhale and relax. 

Just notice how you relax even more and you exhale. Hmm, savoring that sweet, loving breath. Let's do a couple more. Your next inhalation, just holding the inhalation and squeezing the pelvic big floor Mayle. End squeeze. Keep your jaw relaxed, your neck relaxed. Your facial muscles, your scalp, everything is relaxed. And your squeezing deep. Squeeze the intention holding light into your brain, into the center of your brain. Final gland. Thank you. Exhaling. Whenever you're ready. Ah, allowing your brain to relax heavy as if it was gelatin, relaxes, and your skull. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

One more. Whenever you're ready. Taking a deep inhalation, holding the inhalation, and then squeeze pelvic floor, active navel in, squeeze, relax your jaw, your neck, facial muscles, scalp, everything's relaxed, liquid, gold, light going all the way up into your brain, lighting up your brain, opening up the crown, waking up form, and parts of your brain. And when it's enough, exhaling, relax. Muscles, relax. Now, focusing your attention in the center of the brain as if you had the lungs in the center of the brain. Breathing right there, inhaling lighting up the light, the energy in the center of the brain, sweet, loving red. And when you exhale from that center, the energy expands all around you. Your crown opens up more. There's more light. Allow your mind to focus in the center of the brain. In the inhalation, there's an inner glow in, in the exhalation that glow expands all around you. Sweet, loving breath with gratitude. 

From this space of full opening, full awareness, visualize, feel, or no, from the center of your brain, you're connecting all the way up to the sun, all the way up to your soul star. It's your vibration, your frequencies. Just invite all the gifts, all the ideas, all the energies to come from this star all the way down into your brain, into your body. Breathe it in. Inhaling all that light into your brain with so much gratitude, allowing all the codes, the frequencies to come in and wake up for layers of your purpose, for layers of love, light, presence, welcome them with love, with gratitude, 

And staying always in this place of receivership. This place of gratitude, open and receptive, knowing that connection is always there, always available, and that the ideas and the gifts will be revealed whenever the time is right. Letting go of any attachments, just gratitude, visualizing, feeling and knowing that that channel is always open, always connected to the sun, to your soul, star. Now, breathing all that energy into your heart, to your crown, down into the throat, down into the heart. Focus your attention on your heart, the direct connection with all your gifts, with all that's available to you in your presence. And now visualize, feel or know from your heart, you connect down to the earth. Now that light from your heart, you send down whatever color is good, down to the center of the earth, and feeling that connection from the center of the earth to your heart, to your brain, thanking this sweet, feminine energy that reminds me to be open and available to surrender to the flow of life. Knowing that these energies make love in the heart. Staying this place of food presence very gently coming back, gently opening your eyes. I.

LESSON 14: Quantum Flow - Awaken Your Pineal Gland & Expand Your Intuition
--------------------
<v ->Hola; hola, familia.</v> Congratulations, you have arrived for your last Quantum Flow activation. We've built a whole nervous system to support you, to go deeper into meditation in your regular life. We will be opening up the pathways to start opening the pineal gland, so you can receive more, so you can be more available to ideas, to creativity, to new projects, new beginnings, new relationships. It's all related for your capacity to visualize, to magnetize, to receive. This is all a science. It happens through your body. We're going to wake up the body first, just opening the channels, and then we're going to go deep into that meditation. I invite you to take it easy; really listen to your body, and enjoy the journey. Whenever you're ready, feet parallel, relax your shoulders, your arms. You're already an expert on this, right? So just breathing into your belly, allowing your shoulders to open back, allowing your chest to relax, your neck to relax, your jaw to relax, being fully present with the energy. Microbending your knees, get some energy going into your legs. Deep inhalation, then exhaling through the mouth. Relax your head; relax your neck. Inhale, moving that spinal fluid with love, with grace. Let's do one more. Take a deep inhalation; open your arms. Allow them to float up. Exhale, receive the energy from the sky, from the stars, all through your body. Thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you; thank you. Allow your arms to stay the level of your chest. We're going to go today a little deeper into the spine. Just moving, your elbows are closed, and we're going deeper into the core. Breathing gently when you exhale. Waking up that spinal fluid, remember to move it all the way up into the cervical spine too. You exhale through the mouth when you turn. Three more. Inhale; come back to center. Hold it open, spacing your spine; exhale; relax. Nice, inhale all the way up. Exhale; bend your knees, and relax. Cross your arms; relax your head, your neck. Inhale all the way up. Stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, and relax. One more. Inhale all the way up. Hold it right there. Relax your shoulders, your neck, your jaw, receiver mode, and exhale. Receive all the energy flowing through your body. Thank you; thank you; thank you. Relaxing your arms. So for this next activation, we're going to go deeper into the nervous system, releasing your unconscious mind. This is a really good exercise you can do alone, which is moving your body as we've done before, shaking it, while we're going to do a technique called gibberish. Gibberish, it's an ancestral technique, has been used for thousands of years and it's used to release your unconscious mind. You can feel a little weird and kind of strange 'cause it's kind of funny and different, but allow that fun to come through your body. So part of opening the channel is going beyond the limits and the box that we always live in. So, here, starting just this jump of joy, allowing your body to be happy, your organs to bounce and release any tensions. We carry so much tensions in the organs, shoulders, the neck. Just get into that, right, very soft and gentle, pumping the energy from your legs all the way up to your spine; that's it, yeah. Now activating a little more, little shaking. Yeah, and now whenever you're ready, now, gibberish is allowing your mouth to do sounds and move and open up, releasing like this. Play with your tongue. I know it feels weird; you can do it. This is good for releasing. Release your jaw. Keep going; keep going. Feel the music; let it go. Clear the unconscious mind; keep going, guys. This is going to clear your mind and help you go deeper. Trust me. Little more. And come back; just feel the energy. Be present with yourself. Feel the energy. It moves it in your body, right? Amazing, let's move it more now. From the heels, we're going to wake up the energy going into the brain. We did this before; we're going to go deeper now. Bending your elbows, it's okay if you're laughing right now 'cause it's a fun exercise, right? It's good, so inhale up. And allow your arms to relax, just like that. Tibetans used to do this for hours, getting lost fully. They use it in tantra also. It's very powerful ancestral technique to wake up the energy from the heels all the way up into your brain. Be gentle; if it's too much for you, take it easy. Nice, that's it. Okay, now you feel it relaxed. Now let's go deeper. With your hands, tap on the back of your head; wake it up. Move the energy. This is opening the channel into the thalamus gate that we talked about, which is the energy entering your brain and going right into the pineal gland. That's what we want, so wake it up. Uhh, so good, huh? One more. Uhh, and feel. Breathe into the back of your head right there. Focus your mind right there. Bring energy, love, oxygen, all of it. Nice, now go deeper; inhale. The sound helps you release all that tension that's blocking the energy to go up into the brain. You can go softer if that feels good for you. You can go higher; whatever works for you. Every day is different. Every body is different. Always follow your flow. Three more. And stay and feel. Mm, nice. Just savor that; feel into that. Hands wake up the energy field now. Just waking up and the palms are fully related to the heart. So just waking up the energy field all the way up, crown, third eye, throat, heart, that's it; core, navel, and pelvic floor, yeah, wake it up. You're going to love the sensation in your hands after this. Working at a subtle level, yeah, bring it to your heart. Yeah, very good; well done, familia, clap yourself, amazing; yes, that's it. Okay, and feel. Just feel, deep breath. Ah. Sweet, loving breath. Allow the energy to expand from your nervous system all around you. Close your eyes and feel. Mm. Little sound maybe comes out; relax you even more. Connect with your intention; connect. Ultra Presence. Ease, raise and flow, allowing your arms to relax. Staying in this sweet spot. Very gently, when I invite you to sit down comfortably, can be on a pillow, on the floor, or on a chair, whatever feels good for you. Take your time, and sit down. Perfecto, so once you found your comfortable sitting position, whatever that is for you, finding that posture again, and sweet breath, inhaling, very sweetly through your nose, exhaling through your nose. Inhaling. Exhaling. Allow your face to relax, your neck, your shoulders, your jaw. Everything's relaxed. Now that the channel is open, it's all about surrendering to the breath. Keep breathing, soft and gentle, allowing your sympathetic nervous system to calm down. Let's do three more breaths, and we're going to hold on the exhalation, which invites your parasympathetic nervous system in, so you can relax more. One more breath, then exhale all the air out, and just stay there. No inhalation, you're holding the exhalation; relax. If your body wants to get tense a little bit, just relax into it; be fully present with yourself. And whenever you feel called to breathe, wait a little bit, and then breathe very gently; you don't have to push it. very lovingly. You inhale deep, and then you hold the inhalation, and staying relaxed, get your navel in, your pelvic floor active; activate the energy into your brain. Then exhale and relax. That's it. Let's do one more very gentle inhalation; exhalation through your nose; close your eyes. Very gentle, sweet, loving breath. Thank you; thank you; thank you for this journey. Keep breathing, soft and gentle. If there's any tension in your body, be aware of it and relax it, always in gratitude, allowing gratitude to permeate every cell of your being. Let's do three more. And whenever you're ready, exhaling all the air out and staying there, allow your nervous system to rewire. It's okay to feel a little uncomfortable. Relax into it. Teach your body that it's okay to sometimes be uncomfortable. Being comfortable in the uncomfortable, just surrendering to that. Whenever you have that first impulse to breathe, hold it a little more; stay relaxed. Whenever you're ready, following your own rhythm, take a sweet inhalation, hold it, and then squeeze, squeezing the energy from the pelvic floor, from the navel, all the intrinsic muscles of the abdominal, pushing. Stay relaxed; jaw is relaxed; neck is relaxed. Keep pushing; keep squeezing, and then exhale and relax. Just notice how you relax even more when you exhale, savoring that sweet, loving breath. Let's do a couple more. Your next inhalation, just holding the inhalation and squeezing, pelvic floor, navel in, squeeze, your jaw relaxed, your neck relaxed, your facial muscles, your scalp, everything is relaxed, and you're squeezing, deep squeeze. The intention, golden light into your brain, into the center of your brain, pineal gland. Thank you, exhaling whenever you're ready. Aah. Allowing your brain to relax, heavy, as if it was gelatin. Relaxes your skull. Thank you; thank you; thank you. One more. Whenever you're ready, taking a deep inhalation, holding the inhalation and then squeeze, pelvic floor active, navel in; squeeze; relax your jaw, your neck, facial muscles, skull, everything's relaxed, liquid golden light going all the way up into your brain, lighting up your brain, opening up the crown, waking up dormant parts of your brain, and when it's enough, exhaling, relax. Facial muscles, relax. Now focusing your attention in the center of the brain, as if you had the lungs in the center of the brain breathing right there, inhaling, lighting up the light, the energy in the center of the brain. Sweet, loving breath. And when you exhale from that center, the energy expands all around you. Your crown opens up more. It's more light. Allow your mind to focus on the center of the brain. In the inhalation, there's an inner glow. In the exhalation, that glow expands all around you. Sweet, loving breath with gratitude. From this place of full opening, full awareness, visualize, feel, or know, from the center of your brain, you're connecting all the way up to the sun, all the way up to your soul star. It's your vibration, your frequencies. Just invite all the gifts, all the ideas, all the energies to come from this star, all the way down into your brain, into your body. Breathe it in. Inhaling all that light into your brain with so much gratitude, allowing all the codes, the frequencies to come in and wake up the layers of your purpose, the layers of love, light, presence. Welcome them with love and gratitude. And staying always in this place of receivership, this place of gratitude, open and receptive, knowing that connection is always there, always available, and that the ideas and the gifts will be revealed whenever the time is right, letting go of any attachment, just gratitude, visualizing, feeling, and knowing that that channel is always open, always connected to the sun, to your soul star. Now breathing all that energy into your heart, to your crown, down into the throat, down into the heart. Focus your attention on your heart, the direct connection with all your gifts, with all that's available to you and your presence. Now visualize, feel, or know from your heart, you connect down to the earth. now that light from your heart is sent down, whatever color is good, down to the center of the earth, and feeling that connection from the center of the earth to your heart, to your brain, thanking this sweet feminine energy that reminds me to be open and available, to surrender to the flow of life. Knowing that these energies make love in the heart, staying in this place of full presence, very gently coming back, gently opening your eyes. Gently coming back. I invite you to stay in this space of meditation, if that feels good for you. Lie down, whatever feels right. Thank you all so much, infinite moments together. I would love to hear from you in the group. Tell us your experience, your journey, anything you want to share with us. Thank you for saying yes to your gifts.

LESSON 15: Integrate Your Learnings & Be the Flow
--------------------
<v ->Pura vida, familia.</v> I see you. Thank you. Thank you for all the work you've done. Thank you for being here. Thank you for this last lesson of integration. This is where Ultra Presence actually begins. Your course begins here. This is where we really start putting in practice now everything we have gone through, everything we have awakened, because if not, it is just a journey. If not, it's just an experience you had. This is a lifestyle. You live this flow. You're committed to living in the flow state. You're committed to living in Ultra Presence. And of course, this is why you're here. This is why you're still with me, finishing the course, wrapping it up. Thank you for that. Thank you for gifting yourself with that. I want to go back to basics. What is being present? And invite you really to remember the posture, even now that you're watching me. Are you applying the posture? How are you? Are you stiff, or are you relaxed? Are your shoulders back? Is your heart open? How is your breath? Is your breath going down, all the way down into the belly, expanding? Are you breathing through your nose? Are you carrying any tension with you that's unnecessary? Remember the observer. That is the grounding, the capacity to observe your life, every moment of your life. You have that capacity to step back and watch the movie. You are the creator of the movie. Just watch, observe, and enjoy the journey, right? Okay, what's the lesson here? Okay. Oh, I have a pain here in my neck. Okay. Instead of like drinking the pill, just doing a massage, which will relieve it for the moment, ask your body, "Where is this coming from? I'm open and available. Let me know what's the message here?" It's incredible what comes up. It's like, "Oh, I need to talk to that friend that I didn't tell them that I didn't like how they talked to me in that moment." "Oh, I need to clear with my wife, with my husband, because I don't feel it's flowing, but we're faking that everything's okay, right?" Like whatever is going through your life, get raw and real, and be present and listen. Remember, presence is in every area of your life, starting with what you have. Your body, this is your temple. So any pain, okay, what's this pain telling me? Sometimes it's like, "Hey, take it easy. You're pushing too hard." "Hey, relax a little more. Go have fun. Go play; go dance; go move. Go hug a tree. Like go jump in the ocean." Whatever works for you. Maybe it's your body saying, "Hey, just receive." Too much doing, doing, doing, doing. But the best of all is that you get to decodify that, because it's a message that's being codified through your body. But the ones that are here to listen to that, the language of the soul, is you. Every one of us has that capacity to be aware and listen. "Okay, what is my body telling me?" "Hmm, why is my mind going so crazy right now? What's going on?" Sometimes, you have a lot of negative thoughts, because you haven't dealt with something deep inside of you. The core is that unconscious mind that's there. Something happened; you're not forgiving. You're carrying that from your past, from your childhood, whatever that is. And then the core, it's emitting all these thoughts, and we're like trying to cut the thoughts and trying to meditate. When we can't, it's so hard, and it's like, "Oh, I'm just not good for meditation." Everybody is good for meditation. Meditation is our natural state when we are present. It's not about lighting up the candle and the incense, and all that ritual is great, but you don't need to. Your natural state is meditation. You can meditate washing dishes. You can meditate going for a walk. It's being present. Meditation is being present. And the more present you are, the more you are aware of all these thoughts and everything that's coming up for you trying to tell you something. Instead of trying to cut and fix the tree from the leaves, let's go to the roots. So we ask, "Okay, thank you, mind. Thank you for bombarding all these thoughts. Where is this coming from? Show me. Show me, I'm here. I'm open and receptive." You will be amazed of what comes up. So coming back to that questioning. "Let me get curious about this, all these thoughts going on right now in my mind. Let me get curious about this emotion. I'm feeling frustration right now." So go into it. Instead of like, "Oh, let me just go to the gym, or let me just eat, or let me just have sex or something;" that's it's going to kind of anesthetize these first three chakras, right? We're kind of like numbing them, but we're not getting to the core of it. There's a great message behind that frustration. That frustration is energy. That frustration is maybe disconnection that you're not tapped into your purpose. You're not listening to something that's available for you right now to take into your business, to take into whatever platform you have in social media, if that's where you're at, to bring that into your family. That frustration is there for a reason. It's actually your friend. Don't run away from frustration, from anger, from sadness, from all those emotions that are just energy emotion. So let's get them moving. That is Ultra Presence. Get the energy flowing. Get the electricity flowing, alive and awake. And of course, now you know a lot about energetics, your energetic system. Not only your nervous system, but the energy. You are available now to energies around you. You are available. You can feel now or know that they're there. What's going on? What's the message? "Oh, I'm feeling something uncomfortable right now. I don't even know what it is." Listen to that. That is being present. Maybe it's an energy you're feeling from someone that is affecting you, even if it's just a thought. Remember, thoughts are frequencies. Thoughts can affect you more than you even think of. And when you're present, you can connect with that golden light that surrounds you. You are protected. Nobody is going to touch you, no vibration. You can go to the biggest concert, where everybody is in the lowest vibration, and you're going to keep your vibration high because you're present; you're in the house. When you go out of the house, substances or whatever way, running away from being here, of course energies can come into the house and affect you. Be the guardian. Be the guardian of the temple. Your body is your temple. And through your body, you'll get to be a master on all this, all the energies, everything that's going on around you, trusting that even more, experimenting with that, taking the time to stop and just breathe and just be aware. Trusting your intuition, trusting your gut. That's how you start really aligning to your soul, to your highest self. It's a training, right? You heard me, it's a soul gym. You don't go to the gym and lift a hundred pounds first time. I mean, some of you could. Your body's going to hurt a lot if you do that. Like it takes some time to build it up, and it's okay. It's the beautiful process. It's the beautiful journey. This is the soul journey. That is the gift of Ultra Presence. So I invite you to look at every area of your life. How can I show up as my highest self? How are your relationships? Get focussed on it. Do you feel you're opening your heart? Do you feel you're at home? If not, clear it out. Express yourself. Be present. Look at people in the eyes, and tell them what you feel with love, with love from your heart, and allow the conversation to open up through this. They're going to tell you also other things. Don't respond. Feel them. Allow them in. It's their own version of the situation. It's okay; I can listen. I'm there in my center. I'm open. And of course, I'm always open to grow, to evolve, of course. Thank you actually for sharing with me what you're sharing. It doesn't mean it's the ultimate truth. It's their truth, but there's something for me; there's a lesson for me. So am I present in all my relationships? It's so powerful when you feel family for real, when you feel people are there for you 100%. Not because they say you feel them, but this happens when you let go of that gap, of all those masks that we usually put in relationships. When you're vulnerable and you're raw and real, oh, my God, you create the most deep connections with everyone. So bring all these lessons of Ultra Presence to all your relationships. And of course, you're a master now in your self-love and self-relationship. Well, let's apply that to other people too. Why not? Same principles. There's no separation; there's no difference. And what if we take these teachings to business? Business is a relationship. So how connected are you energetically to your business? Whatever that is, it doesn't matter. Are you connected with the business as a being? The business is an energetic being. It's alive. It's got life of itself. Are you listening? Especially if you're an entrepreneur, if you have your own company, your own path set there, are you listening, or are you trying to manipulate to go in a certain way or the other that maybe it's not the highest for the business? So as a CEO, as a leader of the business, the real leader is the one that listens, that's present, that's available. "Okay, where is it going? Why is this not working? Why did I lose all this money last month? Okay, let me ask. Let me ask, what is the next level? What is the evolution of this business?" Ask yourself; it's so beautiful. You will create that intimate relationship with your business, and you will see your business expand and flourish and share all over the world if that's what's needed, if that's what the business is here for. And of course, sometimes, it's making the choice of I'm out of my nine to five routine. I'm out. I am open now to my deepest purpose. And that takes time. Listen, what are the steps? You don't have to let go of everything and just run away. Listen to the steps. Be grateful to all the steps. That's being present. Do it with ease, grace, and flow. You don't have to push it. Even if like you had the biggest revelation, and now you know that you're not living in your purpose, and now you know where you're going, okay, that's great. Okay, let's create that plan. Let's be present to all the steps so you can do it in harmony, in flow. Or maybe it's all about being present to a new business, to a new partnership with someone. Call that person; talk to them. Connect. Follow your intuition. Follow your gut, that gut feeling. Allow yourself to be creative, to play, to dream, to vision. Let yourself go there. It's okay; you're safe. Remember, if that's part of the universal plan or the universal flow, it's all going to be there, revealed for you step by step. It's the magic of life. Sometimes, we're just like seeing the next step. It's okay. That's presence, step by step. All of a sudden you're like, "Now, I get it. Now, all the pieces came together." That's the magic of life. All of a sudden, it's revealed. That's the beauty of it. The mind wants it all now in a certain way. And always deeper than the mind, the soul knows. The soul is in flow. Presence is in flow. Presence is living from your soul where it's all flowing. You are the water. You're water itself, dancing in life and observing. "Whoa, whoa, thank you. Okay, a rock here, an obstacle. All right, let me actually take more impulse on that obstacle and surf the wave. I am water. I am unstoppable when I'm present." When I'm not present, of course the mind comes in the way. I get dramatic. Everything stops. The energy flow stops, because I go into victim mode, because I connect with the story of my past. So do your Quantum Flow. You have so many practices, right, to come back to the flow state. I invite you to do them every day, if that's possible. Of course, there's always deeper layers. Choose the ones you love the most. Play with them. Oh, and maybe choose the ones that you had more resistance because there's something there for you. There's a gift. I assure you, if you had resistance in a practice and you repeat it and repeat it and repeat it, and you get to find bliss in the practice, oh my God, something is going to shift huge in your life because the practice that we do, that spiritual practice of Quantum Flow, energetic practice is completely related to your daily life. There's something that's reflected in that part of your nervous system in your life, in some area of your life. Once you get through that and you go through the alchemy, you go through the resistance, you surrender to go deeper, whoa, something opens up. That is the power of this work. That is the power of presence. You're going beyond just trying to solve something. It's actually about being in the flow. And once you're in the flow, then of course you're going to be guided where it goes, how it is, where's the next step? Always synchronicity. Remember synchronicity. One after the other; one after the other. Don't stop the flow. Surf the wave. Be the wave. And if you catch yourself stressed, if you catch yourself feeling tense, anything that's disconnecting you from your natural state of flow, from your natural state of presence, just do your Quantum Flow. Just do your breath. Just do your movement. Just stop; breathe. Allow yourself to release that, instead of reacting from that and keeping your life feeding those patterns. Cut them; let them go. The only way to recreate yourself, it's stop firing and wiring your nervous system in the same way, because you're going to be acting, thinking, moving always in the same way, in the same box. And of course, let's bring this presence to everything we do. How are we eating? Are we grateful with our food? Is that food in our plate before we eat it aligned to my body right now? Does it feel good to put this into my body even if it's not healthy, or not as healthy as I would like, or not as organic? It's okay. Bless it up. Be grateful with it. You have a whole fire here that can transform anything when the mind doesn't get in the way. Oh, my God, I ate this. I ate too much. Too much fat, too much sugar, too much this. It's okay. Enjoy your food. Feel into it. Do the best you can to align the food with the highest version of you, and enjoy the journey. If it's that chocolate cake that you love, when you eat it, eat every piece of it. Allow it to expand you into your intention, into the love of life, not just eating unconsciously, and then you don't even know how many pieces you ate 'cause you weren't even there. Bring presence to every bite. To digest your food starts on the mouth. Sometimes, we eat food so fast that it gets heavy because the first digestion is actually the enzymes on the mouth. Chew your food until you make it liquid. Drink your food, and chew your liquids. That's basics of nutrition being present for your body. That's what your body needs. Give all the enzymes in the mouth to all the food you're taking, to everything, even a smoothie. I used to take smoothies, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug. All the best superfoods in the world, like, oh my God, it was a bomb. Superfast. I wouldn't even feel it, digest it. Like allow the nutrition to come through your palate up into your brain. Food is not only matter. Food is energy. Allow that energy to penetrate. Allow your body to understand the language between food and vibration, energy, life, love, all of it. There's no separation. That is presence. Presence in everything you do. Now, you see the breath, how the breath can be just a meditation. Just the simplest breath, not even holding it, nothing. Just through the nose as long and gentle and deep as you can, that's almost imperceptible. And you enter that state of, ahhh, openness just through the breath. Bring that presence with all the tools you have right now. You have so much. How you're walking in space, how your foot goes on the floor. What part of the foot are you putting on the floor? Is it just your right side, your left side, inner, outer? How do you stand? Be aware of everything. Enjoy the ride. Enjoy the journey. And just be the observer. And really feeling like your walk is a meditation. You're not walking just unconsciously. Bring that presence to the walk. And when you're walking in presence, oof, an idea comes through. Oof, an energy comes through. It's beautiful. There is no separation between, "Oh, let me just meditate to receive the next level of my business." And I'm like, "Okay, okay, with my journal, ready to go." I doubt if that's going to <v ->that's going to come from your mind.</v> It's your rational mind. Enter the flow state through all these ways; you know how to enter anything you do. Enter the flow state, and then allow it to flow through you. It's so beautiful. It's your natural state. Your natural state is genius. You are a genius. Remember that. You are a genius, and genius comes when you're present. Fully embodied presence, familia. Yes. And I want to invite you to journal a little more. What are you going to commit to? What are you committing to right now in your life? Your whole lifestyle, look at it. Related to your purpose, to your relationships, to your business, to how you perceive money. Yes, and I invite you to journal around every area of your life. How can I be more present? How can I show up from my highest self? Remember, the mindset is very important. What are you focusing on? Write it down as it's already done. You are saying it to yourself. You're saying it to the universe. But you're not only just repeating that mindset and that affirmation. You're embodying it through all this process. That is the full completion of Ultra Presence. That is who you are. Ultra Presence. I am. Repeat with me. I am Ultra Presence. I am Ultra Presence. I am presence. And so it is. Let's breathe all this energy in. Hold it right there and exhale. Relax. Allow all this information to just flow through you. Deep energy in. Hold it with the tips of your fingers. Wake up your thymus gland. Knock it. Knock on the door of the heart right there. Hold it. Relax your shoulders, your neck, and exhale. Ahhhhh. Expand the field all around you. Mm, Ultra Presence once more. Inhale. Hold it. Knock on heaven's door right there. And whenever you're ready, ahhhhh, expand the field all around you. Stay with your eyes closed. Relax your arms. Relax your shoulders, your neck, your jaw. Allow the breath to happen naturally. Allow yourself to tap into full gratitude right now for completing this process, for going fully committed in your life in how you show up, in all the release you've already done. Thank you; thank you; thank you. All the gifts you have awakened. Thank you; thank you; thank you. All the awareness you have created, you've opened up to. Thank you; thank you; thank you. I am here. I am now. I am presence. Slowly opening your eyes. Wow. Gracias, familia. Gracias. Desde mi corazon. From my heart. A tu corazon. To your heart. One heart. As we say, pura vida.
