Intro 1: Welcome to zivaKIDS for Adults
--------------------

- Hi, friends. Bravo on making one of the best decisions in your family's life. Having these tools will help all of you to be more resilient, kinder to each other, and it may just increase the amount of joy in your home. So welcome. I'm Emily Fletcher, founder of Ziva Meditation, author of "Stress Less, Accomplish More," and most importantly, mom to Jasper. The team and I created zivaKids because it is the training we get asked for the most. We created our own because we didn't see any mindset or resilience training for kids out there that was on par with what we wanted to create or one that mirrored the proven tools that we teach to adults. We've been in development on this for over two years, collaborating with writers and puppeteers from Sesame Street and being advised by some of the world's leading child psychologists and Harvard professors, all to make what we hope to be the world's best mental training for kids. Plus three of us on staff at Ziva are moms now, so we know firsthand what it's like to be raising kids in this day and age. So look, I know that this is an intense time to be a kid and an intense time to be a parent. You or your child might be struggling right now. You might not know what else to try, or perhaps you're already a huge fan of meditation, and you're excited to share this gift with your kids. Regardless of why you're here, you decided to say yes, and the fact that you're here is a huge success, and I want to celebrate that. So let's start with some comforting news. I have taught more than 30,000 people to meditate, and it is one of the great joys in my life to wake up to emails every morning from my students, sharing how these tools changed their life. Ziva grads are enjoying deeper, more restful sleep. They're experiencing less anxiety, feeling more creative, and getting much more done in one day. And one of my favorite benefits the students report is the undeniable knowing deep down that everything is going to be okay. And all these benefits are achieved by reducing the amount of stress in our nervous systems. And this is what we're going to be teaching your children how to do in zivaKids, so they can get back to the business of being kids. Now, the thing that makes Ziva so special is that this practice will help your kids to do what they love even better. So if your kid's really into soccer, you may want to introduce this as a way to help them get better at soccer. Same goes for school or dance or whatever they're into. Having mental tools will help them excel and, more importantly, enjoy their passions. One of the things that makes zivaKids unique is that your kids will be taught to ultimately meditate on their own without needing me or an iPad or headphones. We are big on self-sufficiency at Ziva. I mean, who wants more screen time for their kids? So this goes beyond feeling better in the moment. This is cultivating a consistent practice that will change your child's brain for the better and give them the tools to get out of fight or flight, become more resilient, and increase their emotional intelligence. And the best part? We're going to have a lot of fun. My intention is that they love it so much that they want to come back to the videos time and time again. And this is going to give you and your little ones a new and powerful way to bond. So in the next section we'll cover the importance of grownups modeling the meditation habit, and I'll make sure you understand how to navigate this course with ease. And finally, we'll go over setting and, more importantly, releasing expectations. So as the mother of a toddler, I am all too aware of the stressful, messy world that we could be handing our children: social media, bullying, climate change, school pressures, and the lasting effects of a global pandemic are all contributing factors to our kids' stress. These effects on their health are pretty staggering, and I don't want to freak you out, but I do want to share some statistics that make it clear just how much kids in this day and age need meditation: 4.4 million kids in the US alone have diagnosed anxiety, and another 1.9 million have diagnosed depression. Depression and anxiety diagnoses in children have been increasing by 8.4% annually, one in six kids ages two to eight are diagnosed with a mental or behavioral disorder. Suicide rates in kids and teens have increased by 56% in the last two decades. Now you likely understand the enormity of what your kids are dealing with, or you wouldn't be here. So please give yourself another huge pat on the back for taking action to support them. I also want you to know that you're not alone. We surveyed over 2000 folks in the Ziva community, and here's what we found. Kids ages four to 16 are most stressed out by school, socializing, siblings, and tests, and this stress can manifest as emotional outbursts, irritability, negative self-talk, difficulty concentrating, and trouble sleeping. Did you know that only 4% of respondents say they didn't notice any symptoms of stress in their children? So if your kids are feeling stressed, again, know that you're not alone. And I'm so glad that you have chosen to get help. Stress is so ubiquitous that it's hard to separate it from who we are. And this means that kids often don't see stress as something that comes and goes, but instead they begin to see their negative feelings and struggles as the kind of person they are or who they're becoming. Now toward the end of this video, we're going to talk about positioning meditation as a positive thing, a daily habit that will help them to be better at all the things they love doing, not as some fix for a behavioral problem. Now there's one more huge factor in your kids' stress. Are you ready? Really ready? It's you. Now, I know this one stings a little, but we really have to be the change here. Kids learn to walk by watching us walk. They learn to talk by hearing us talk. And the same true for meditation. If you don't have a practice, if you are not regulating your moods or stress, then they are learning by what you do, not what you say. Have you ever heard of the Suzuki method? This is a style of music education where the adult has to learn at least one song on the violin before the child can even touch the instrument. Now, I know this sounds extreme, but I've seen this happen firsthand. My goddaughter, whose name is Bird, has had a daily meditation habit since she was six. And she said there's no way she would meditate every day if she didn't see her mom doing it and inviting her to join. So the number one reason why it's important for parents to meditate: our kids absorb everything, even unspoken stress. According to Psychology Today, parents with high stress demonstrate less warmth, lower levels of responsiveness, less affection, and are more likely to use discipline that's either harsh or uninvolved. In contrast, parents with less stress use more positive parenting behaviors such as warmth, sensitivity, listening, and understanding. So when parents reduce their own stress, they drastically reduce their kids' stress. And here's the deal, stress drains you of your time, your energy and your patience. And it's not your fault. Financial stress, work stress, family stress are real, and they set off a chemical reaction in your brain and body that keep you tired, irritable, and at the end of your rope. In fact, in zivaOnline, which is our most popular meditation training for adults, I give a lecture on this very topic called The Neuroscience of Stress. And I included a four- minute audio for you here. So I highly suggest you take a listen. So please hear me when I say this. Stress disallows you from acting in accordance with what you know. Stress is what makes you lose your patience or your temper with your kid, but it is possible to reduce your stress. And meditation is the most efficient and effective way to do that. The less stressed and happier you are, the easier it will be to model that for your kids. Modeling behavior is a well-proven tactic for encouraging positive behavior in your children. If your kids see you reading, they'll want to read. If they see you being kind and patient, they'll be kind and patient. If they see you meditating, they'll want to meditate. So let's make a pact. I'll deal with your kids' stress; you deal with yours. And if you want some help on making this a daily habit, we've got you covered. Now let's talk about what zivaKids is and what it's not. So zivaKids is designed to make your kid more resilient, and we define that as brave, creative, and kind. Now these techniques will help them to move through their feelings more elegantly. It is not meant to numb your child's emotions. In fact, they may feel more, but they're going to move through those feelings faster. Now, whether your child is taking the kids' or the preteens' course, the formats are very similar. So I'll walk you through what's inside both and how to navigate the training with your little ones. Kids ages four through eight will move through seven lessons in story format featuring my very good friend, Z Bunny. So through interactive storytelling, they'll learn a fun practice including movement, mindfulness, and manifesting. And each lesson builds on the previous one to help drive the concepts home and so that they have the techniques to take with them for life. Now, I recommend you sit with them, watch with them, answer their questions, ask them about it. And here's the not-so- secret secret: your kids want to be with you. The more you can show that you're interested in zivaKids, the more they're going to be interested too. Now at the end of the seventh lesson, you're going to unlock an audio download of me walking you through the technique, so you and your little ones can listen to it, practice together, and work towards self-sufficiency. Plus, Z Bunny is a hoot and a half. Jasper asks me to see Z Bunny every single day. So these videos are meant to be watched again and again. This way there's no pressure to memorize or perfect the technique the first time through. My hope is that zivaKids becomes your kids' favorite show. You and your kids will also get access to a vault of bonus materials, including coloring pages and worksheets, suggested reading for kids and for you, an audio library of guided exercises that you can do yourself or with your kids. And the thing I'm most excited about? Your zivaKids sticker chart; you'll get a printable sticker chart with instructions for helping the whole family stick to the practice. And you can help your little one earn stickers or what we call badges in the course for meditating daily. Now, when they meditate three days in a row, they're going to get to pick an activity from a printable coupon book. And all these activities in the coupons are supereasy and screen free, things like a one-song dance party, or your kid gets to pick what you have for dinner. This is all to inject more fun, movement, and presence into your family's life. Now kids ages nine through 14, in the pre-teen section, will start with an intro video and then get seven lessons. Now this training is more advanced both conceptually and in the techniques that I teach. These videos are approximately 15 minutes each. And through interactive storytelling, they're going to learn an age-appropriate version of the three Ms that we teach to adults. So this is mindfulness, meditation, and manifesting. Now the technique is different from what you would learn in zivaOnline, but it's a great way for them to start. Now, like the format for younger kids, each lesson builds on the previous one to help them drive the concepts home. And at the end of the seven lessons, you'll unlock an audio download of the technique, so your kids can listen to it and help them practice doing it on their own. Now again, these videos are meant to be watched over and over, so there's no pressure to get it right the first time. Now, you and your preteens will also get access to a vault of bonus materials, including writing prompts for journaling, an age-appropriate yoga video, audio bonuses for this unique phase of life, suggested reading for you and for your kids, and an audio library of guided exercises. Now, if you have older kids, I have a special surprise for you. I made two special teen bonus audios, as I know this is a very challenging phase of life. And once your kid is around 16, then they will be eligible to enroll in the adult training along with you. And in the meantime, these audios will help. So, we just covered what you can expect from the course; now let's talk about what to expect of yourselves and of your kids. Now, the only rule I have for this training is to release your expectations. First, release your expectations of yourself. This training is in no way meant to make you a meditation teacher. That's not your responsibility, to become a teacher. This course will do that for you. You have enough on your plate. Your job is to plant the meditation seed, to be with them on this journey. And to let your child lead the way. They are the superheroes; we are going to be the sidekicks. Next, let's talk about ways to release expectations of our kids. So the first thing to know is that there's no need for them to sit still or concentrate. Over the last 10 years of teaching kids meditation in person, I've seen parents get frustrated or even embarrassed when their kids are, like, "disrupting" the class, when in reality their kids are just being kids. They were fidgeting or asking questions. Now, our expectations on our children can often be unrealistic. And in this course, we are not striving for perfection; we're going for progress. Meditation is an intensely personal thing. So please work with your child with their energy levels and with their attention spans. Think of yourself as an accountability buddy instead of you being the meditation police. Now, during and after this course, your kid is still going to be a kid. During the videos, they might fidget; they might interrupt; they might say that they don't want to watch it; they might not want to practice. And these are all perfectly normal things for a child to do. Remember, we model the behavior; sit and watch the videos; invite them to sit with you; maybe color or write while you watch. Now the second thing can happen is that they lose interest in meditating. Now at their age, we're simply planting the seeds of meditation and exposing them to it. Learning this practice is exercising their ability to go inside for their fulfillment and looking less to parents or classmates for approval. So just like any skill or new toy, they might be gung-ho to start and then peter out over time, or they might resist at first and then warm up to it. It's not for us to dictate or control the timing. It is up to us to keep offering the opportunity and the resource and to remind them that it's there when they're ready. So I want to share that I've had people take my course and then stop meditating and then come back to it years later. One of the more famous meditation books in the world was written by a doctor in his fifties who learned to meditate when he was 18 and promptly quit. Decades later, he started seeing seemingly miraculous results from his patients who are all attributing the results to meditation. So he started back and then became a bestselling meditation author. So again, the timing is not up to us. Just like with adults, it's important that your child has something that we call worthy inquiry. Meditation is something you simply cannot force on them, but there is extraordinary value in offering them a chance to know that it's an option for them whenever they're ready to commit. So ziva is not a numbing tool. Now the point of this training is to give you and your child tools to better handle their world. We already have so many numbing tools at our disposal: tv, video games, junk food, sugar, social media. And meditation is very much the opposite. Both the videos and the practice itself will train your child to be comfortable with acknowledging and feeling their feelings so they can move through them more elegantly. This training will give them tools to access their fulfillment internally versus seeking it from peers or even from you. And we'll talk more about this in a future video. Alright, friends, you're doing great. We are almost to the end of your first training. I just want to share my five best tips for success. One, move towards the positive. Remind your kids that this practice is going to make them better at all the things that they love. Two, lead by example, not by being the meditation police. Remember, kids absorb everything, and they model their behavior after us. Three, rewatch these videos anytime you like. They're here for you, and you can revisit as often as your kid wants to. Four, do the training with an accountability buddy. Talk to your child's friend's parents. Get a friend or group of friends to go through the training together. Did you know that you're 95% more likely to commit to a healthy habit if you have a community doing it with you? And number five, progress not perfection. Please don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Let your kids be kids. So here are a few things you can do before the training to set your kids up for success. So take a few days before, and get excited. You might remember this from potty training. We want to make sure to paint this as a fun adventure that you're going to go on together. And unlike with potty training, this time, you won't be lying. Now the seven lesson videos are a true delight. The little ones are going to love Z Bunny. And I did my very best to try and be cool for the preteens, which likely made me look like a total dingdong, but hopefully they love the practice so much that they forgive me for trying to be cool. Number two, get all the necessary materials ready. For the little ones, print out the coloring pages and worksheets. Have them nearby on the first day so they can color while they watch. For pre-teens, all they need is a journal or paper and something to write with. So the third thing you can do is join the zivaKids Group. This way you're going to meet other parents that are going on a similar journey, and you'll be able to support and encourage each other. And lastly, this is optional, but totally recommended. Treat yourself to zivaOnline. The more you understand this practice, the better you're going to be able to model this behavior for your kids, and it's going to make you better at all the things you love doing as well. Alright, friends, I am so excited for you. I'm so excited for your kids. Please let me know how the training goes for you, and let us know how we can support your family. All right. Happy meditating.

Intro 2: Emotional and Physical Detox
--------------------

- Welcome back, friends. Bravo on committing and making this a priority. Have you ever heard the saying, "When is the best time to plant a tree? Twenty years ago. When's the second best time? Today." Well, the same holds true for meditation. One thing I hear from my students time and time again is that they wish they'd started sooner. What an enormous gift you're giving your child. This is going to pay lifelong dividends for all of you. Now, the Dalai Lama said, "If every 8-year-old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation." Now you've likely heard this quote before, but let's take a moment to really imagine if this were the reality. If every kid knew how to manage stress, trust themselves, feel their feelings, and design their day, how much better would life be for all of us? How much time would we save? How much money in therapy? How many fewer wars would there be? You are giving this gift to your child so they are set up for a lifetime of success. So in addition to the physiological benefits of what your children will learn in zivaKids, we're also zeroing in on certain qualities that meditation will encourage. Things like bravery, creativity, and kindness. So in the training, your kids will receive badges after each lesson as they learn about each quality. You'll see their badges inside the course. Now, I recommend calling out and praising these qualities as you see your children exhibiting them. Reinforce progress, and call attention to when you see them becoming more resilient. Now this will look different for every child. So what exactly will your kid learn in zivaKids? Well, first we'll talk about the four to eight year olds, and if you've only signed up for preteens, this will only take a sec. Or you can skip ahead. So what specifically will I be teaching your little superhero? It's a simple technique that incorporates movement, mindfulness, and manifesting. So kids start with something called shake it off. 'Cause kids need to get their energy out and move their bodies. Now this exercise is silly but superfun, and it's effective in reducing stress and priming them to sit down into stillness. Just like it's easier to train a dog after a long run, it's much easier for kids to settle into stillness after movement. Now in the animal kingdom, shaking it off is an essential way to dislodge trauma from the nervous system. It signals to the brain and body that the danger has passed and that the fight-or-flight reaction can safely conclude. Research shows that it is effective in humans too. This is called therapeutic tremoring, literally shaking off stress. Now, a recent study found that as participants incorporated self-induced therapeutic tremoring into their routines on a regular basis, they reported more frequent positive emotions towards themselves and greater confidence in their ability to deal with adversity. So this exercise is fast, fun, and supereffective. It's something you can do together whenever you're having a stressful day and need some relief. Then we move into affirmations. So scientists have long marveled at the efficacy of affirmations. A study out of University of Michigan and UCLA have uncovered that self-affirmation activates the reward centers of our brain. Now these brain circuits have been shown to do things like dampen pain and help us maintain composure in the face of a threat. They also found that by increasing activity in the brain connected to self-processing, we can better handle painful, negative, or threatening information. Now, when threatened, those who practice affirmations can better reflect on sources of self-worth, such as their core values. Now, each day I will help remind your superhero that we are brave, creative, and kind. Next is the belly balloon. This is a deep breathing technique to ground your little one in their body and bring them back into the present moment. Breathwork is a powerful way to reconnect your mind and body. Elongating the exhale from the inhale stimulates something called the vagus nerve, which is the superhighway that runs between our brains all the way down to our colons. And when we stimulate and soften this vagus nerve, we move the body into something called parasympathetic, which is the rest-and-digest mode, instead of being in sympathetic, which is fight or flight. So obviously this is really useful for adults and children alike. And finally, the wish balloon, which is quite advanced. So this manifesting technique is a way for your kid to get clear on how they want to feel. Manifesting is a key part of the Ziva technique, and there's a reason why I teach this to adults as well. Olympians, professional athletes, and Oprah have been practicing these types of tools to create a life they love. Now, manifesting isn't the same as having a magic wand. The trick to manifesting is simply asking yourself, "What would I love right now?" By doing this, you begin to train your brain to see opportunities that move you closer to your dreams and filter out the obstacles. Thoughts become things. We know this, but teaching our children this early will help them identify the things that bring them joy so they can make empowering decisions. Now let's talk about what the preteens will learn. Now, if you're just here for the younger kids, you can skip ahead. Preteens will learn a version of the three Ms that I teach at Ziva: mindfulness, meditation, and manifesting. So first we start with something called Squeeze Me. Now this technique is essentially self-massage, and it does more than just feel good. This has been practiced for thousands of years as part of Ayurveda, which is the sister science to the type of meditation that I teach at Ziva. Now, self-massage has been shown to relieve stress by releasing bliss chemicals like oxytocin into the brain and body. It also activates our parasympathetic nervous system, which is how we access rest-and-digest mode. It's a great way to prepare the body for the rest of the technique. Now we add gratitude as part of Squeeze Me. When I was this age, I was so judgmental of my body. I wish I had a daily practice of thanking my body instead of attacking it. Then we move into mindfulness. Now I'll walk your child through a very simple but highly effective breathing technique. It's been proven to stop anxiety attacks in minutes, and you can practice it anywhere, anytime. It's called the 2x breath, and it's adept at grounding your child in their body and bringing them back into the present moment. This is also in zivaOnline for when you're ready to learn for yourself. Now, like the belly balloon we discussed a moment ago, this exercise stimulates our vagus nerve, which runs all the way from our brain down to our colon and is the superhighway between the brain and the body. By stimulating our vagus nerve, we activate our parasympathetic nervous system. So again, this is rest-and-digest mode. This reduces your heart rate, lowers your blood pressure, and reopens communication between your brain and body. Now for the main event, the meditation portion. Now a lot of people confuse mindfulness and meditation as being the same thing when, in reality, they're quite different. Now, the way I like to teach your kids is this: take your hand and make a fist. This is mindfulness, where we're focusing. And now take your fist and open it. This is meditation, where we're surrendering. Now, mindfulness is great at getting rid of stress fast and in the moment. So if your child gets a bad grade or gets in a fight with a friend, this is a great time for mindfulness, for a state change, versus meditation actually goes in and removes your stress from the past. It heals stress and trauma we store in our nervous systems by giving the body deep healing rest. Now we now know from epigenetics that we can inherit somewhere between two and seven generations of stress from our ancestors. Meditation not only heals your stress and our ancestors' stress, but it prevents us from passing it down to future generations. And when we give our kids these tools, amazing things can happen, like building resilience by increasing the connection between their right and left brain so they can access creative solutions even while under stressful circumstances, becoming able to regulate their emotions so they have a better chance at remaining kind and calm even when they don't feel great themselves. These tools will help your child turn the "I can't" into, "let's see what happens." And it'll help you transition from what's the worst that could happen to what's the best that could happen. Now finally, your preteens will end with manifesting. Manifesting simply means consciously creating a life you love. It's you reminding yourself of your dreams. Did you know that 80% of the thoughts we think each day are repetitive, and many of them are negative? So manifesting is a way to move towards the positive, not away from the repetitive negative. Now by manifesting right after the meditation, your child will be training their RAS, or reticular activating system. This helps to filter out the negative noise and see opportunities when they arise. All we're doing is asking ourselves, "What would I love right now?" When we do this, we begin to train ourselves to visualize the outcomes and the person that we want to be. Our thoughts become things. Teaching our children this early will help them to identify the things that bring them joy so they can make good decisions and fuel their dreams. So my goal in teaching the three Ms to pre-teens is they will innately know how to handle anything that is thrown their way. Now, this might be surprising for some of you, but when your child starts a meditation practice, there can be a bit of physical and emotional detox that starts to occur. Now this is because we're giving the body deep, healing rest, and when we give the body rest, it knows how to heal itself. And one of the things it's healing itself from is stress, not only from today but all the stuff we have stored in our nervous system. We call this process unstressing. Now, when we teach this to adults, a catharsis happens. When we heal our stress on a cellular level, the trauma we've been holding on in our bodies can often have the same flavor on the way out as it did on the way in. This can mean some tears, some anger, or insomnia. Now we purposefully made this technique gentle and age appropriate for your kids, especially the four to eight year olds. Chances are they won't experience too much unstressing, but because the nine to 14 year olds will be meditating with a mantra - again, it's a gentle mantra that is age appropriate - but it is more likely that they'll have some of this emotional and physical detox. So if this happens, please do not panic. This is part of the process, and it will pass. There is no way around but through. And the best way you can support your child through this period is to simply be with them. Give them space and time to feel anything and everything that's coming up. There's nothing to fix; there's nothing to solve. Just give them permission to cry if they're sad, to rage if they're angry. I recommend baths, massage, walks, physical play, journaling; all of these things can help your child move through this temporary release. So again, this practice is not meant to numb your child. Should they experience any increased emotions, the most important thing is to let them feel their feelings. This is something I'll be teaching them throughout the videos. And the reality is that most of us are working against decades of being trained not to feel our feelings, decades of being told that we're a good boy or a good girl if we shove our emotions down. We're like, "Shh. Don't cry; have a bottle." "Shh. Don't cry; have a toy." "You're okay. You're fine; you're fine." But here, all of the emotions are not only allowed but encouraged. What I'll say to your kid again and again is that you have to feel it to heal it. We have a nerdy little theme song that goes like this, "It's better out than in, uh, better out than in, uhuh, better out than in." And so if your child is having a moment, just encourage them, and remind them that this is in fact stress leaving the body. What we really want to do is celebrate the catharsis of better out than in. And of course it might be uncomfortable in the moment. It might be embarrassing at the grocery store if they throw a temper tantrum. But think of all the money that you'll be saving on therapy later. Now, I'm not suggesting you allow yourself to be manipulated by your child's tantrums. I am suggesting you acknowledge and honor the intensity of their emotions. Give them the space and time they need to process, and let them feel safe and supported as they move through to the new now. This will be worth it, especially in the long term, for your kids. The reality is kids this age have big feelings, and the more we stifle them, the more they manifest in different ways. So it's better for their brains and bodies to move through these emotions by feeling them fully. Alright, friends, this is big, brave work. But I promise that if you allow your kid to move through this, if you give them the space and the time that they need to feel, once they move through, the stress is never coming back. And your kid is going to have these resilience tools to take with them for life. So bravo, you're doing great. You only have one more training, and I'll see you in the next one. Goodbye.

========================================

Intro 3: Go Forth and Meditate
--------------------

- Congratulations. We're doing it. You made it to the final training video for parents. So thank you for being so committed to your kid's meditation journey. Now, once your kid completes the training, please know you can enjoy watching these videos again and again. Each time you and your kids watch it, you'll likely hear something differently and learn something new. Now, this practice is just that. It's something we practice until it becomes a daily habit, and eventually you're going to wonder how you ever made it through the day without it. Now, I want to share four ways for you to be a great sidekick for your kids' meditation journey. So the first is the Popeye effect. Do you remember this? Where Popeye single handedly convinced a generation of kids to eat spinach? Not because they love spinach, but because they believed it would make them strong and give them big muscles. So this is a great reminder for how we encourage our kids to meditate, not as a way to fix anything, as they're already perfect, but as a tool to help them get better at everything they love. And I said it earlier, and I'll say it again. The special thing about Ziva is that this practice will help your kids do what they love even better. And number two is don't be the meditation police. How would you get your partner or sibling to do something? Likely by practicing it yourself, sharing the awesome benefits, and then inviting them to join. Right? So guilt, shame, and force are not effective tactics, especially not with our kids. Cleaning your own house and inviting them to join you is much more enjoyable for everyone. Okay, so number three is to take the pressure off, and trust the timing. This course is in no way meant to make you a meditation teacher, so please take that pressure off of yourself. Your kid is the superhero, and you are the sidekick. So let them lead the way. I'll do the teaching. Also, take the pressure off your kids. They're just kids. They're going to fidget, resist, lose interest. And remember, this is not meant to be a behavior modifying tool. The goal is to help our kids feel more, not less. So by feeling their feelings as they're happening, they can move through them more elegantly. Also know that the timing is not up to us. Kids will take to it when they take to it. If they aren't into it right off the bat, no worries. This doesn't mean you are a failure. It doesn't mean the course is a failure. They may come back to it later, especially if they see you doing it. And a reminder that this course is going to be here for you as long as it exists. And finally, tip number four is to meditate. The easiest way to inspire your child to meditate is for you to have a practice yourself. Children model the behavior that they see. So if they see you dedicating yourself to your practice, they're going to want to emulate that behavior. Now, should you want to learn, zivaOnline is our flagship meditation training that will teach you to be a self-sufficient meditator in only 15 days. And imagine what a joy it would be for you to meditate with your child. I love meditating with my mom and my sister over the holidays. It's one of my very favorite things to do. And the other thing I'm superproud of is that my 2-year-old, Jasper, who you met, he's even sat with me a few times at two, and his favorite book is Mindfulness. He goes, "Squeeze." And he goes, "Heartbeat, boom, boom, boom, boom." And he goes ... And it's so adorable. He also loves to do yoga poses because he sees me doing yoga. So really, truly, we want to be the change. We want to uplevel ourselves and invite our children along for the ride. So bravo to you. Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for raising your hand and saying, I want to be part of the solution. Your kids are really lucky to have you. So thank you from the bottom of my heart. We are here to support you. Please join the zivaKids group. Know that the whole team and I will be there cheering you on, supporting you and your family in every way that we can enjoy. And I'll see you soon.

Part 2: Preparation

Intro 4:Welcome to Ziva
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape; I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still, I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going be brave. I'm going be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going to be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Hi. Welcome to Ziva!

- Welcome to Ziva!

- Welcome to Ziva. - Welcome to Ziva! - Welcome to Ziva!

- Welcome to Ziva. The reason why I like Ziva meditation is it's a very friendly environment to like start meditation, especially at a younger age. Like with Z Bunny and especially all the online courses I took, it definitely inspired me to do it more than I ever wanted to.

- I really love the manifesting portion. I think that is so important. Goal setting keeps you going.

- Hi friends. I'm Emily, and I am so dang delighted that you have said yes to becoming the most amazing version of you. So this is a quick intro video to set you up for success and to let you know what you're in for as we start this amazing journey together. Now, some of you might be here because you are genuinely interested in meditation, and some of you might be here because your parents are making you. Either way, my job is to let you know how much more fun life can be when you have the tools that I'm going to share in the next seven lessons. And look, I'm not here to turn you into some meditating hippie chanting "Om." I'm here to talk about the science of why tools like meditation, mindfulness, and manifesting can help us to feel like superheroes. And by superheroes, I'm sorry, but no, I am not promising that you're going to be able to fly or shoot spiderwebs out of your hands. I am actually talking about something even more valuable. It's more valuable in your life now, and it's going to be more valuable as you grow up. Now you're going to be able to use these tools in the course to unlock your very own superpowers. Superpowers, like being kind, feeling brave, and being able to access unlimited creativity on demand. I mean, can you imagine how that might make life more fun for you? How much easier your day would be with more bravery, more creativity, and more kindness?

- I felt pretty creative when I made a pinch pot for the first time ever in my life.

- I was kind when my friend fell on the ground, and he was hurt, and I helped him up and took him to the nurse.

- I felt brave when I protected my brother from a bully when I was five years old.

- So how does this meditation thing work? So right after you fall asleep, but before you start to dream, your brain is in this beautiful state where it's free to think amazing thoughts. It's like a bird soaring freely through the air. And when your brain is in this place, it's easy to access your inner wisdom. Like a talented author or a teacher, you can think of great thoughts, right, cool stories, even create new inventions. So meditation, what you and I are learning together here, helps you to access this same place in your brain. And you know what? Your kid brain can find this meditative state much easier than an adult brain. Did you know that it takes me 10 hours to teach adults to meditate? We're going to be able to do this in just a few minutes a day for seven days. And look, sure. Meditation can help you if you're stressed out. But I'm actually more interested in how this can help you be the most amazing version of you. How it's going to help you do all the things you love, but better. Pretty cool, huh?

- Meditation and Ziva helps me utilize everything around me and to feel better, utilize my brain, my body, my guitar.

- In sports, I used to get so nervous before games. So I started meditating right before I had to play. And that was able to really get my nerves under control. And once that happened, I was able to play amazing, the way I know how to play.

- I think it, it really opens up my mind to all the things that I enjoy, even if I don't realize that I enjoy it at the moment. If I'm doing my art or drama or something like that, it really does like put my mind to that specific point in my life and what I'm doing.

- So you'll only need a few things for this training, a journal and something to write with, a willingness to learn. And about 15 minutes a day, preferably first thing in the morning, for seven days straight. And at the end of those seven days, you will have your very own Ziva practice. You're going to have these skills and tools to take with you for life. Whenever you're feeling stressed or sad or just want to do better on a test, you can access your superpowered brain to help you. And if you need a reminder, you can come back to these videos anytime you like. I'm going to be here cheering you on.

- Hooray!

- All right, so what are the cues that will unlock your superpowers? The Ziva technique is made up of three Ms: mindfulness, meditation, and manif-

- Z Bunny, what are you doing here?

- Hi.

- Hi. This, this is not the little kids training. This is for big kids. I'm really sorry, but puppets are too babyish for them.

- But, but, but, but, but, but look how cool I am.

- What's he doing?

- See, I'm hip. I got shades.

- Z Bunny? They do look really good on you. I know, but you're six. I'm sorry. I love you, but you got to scram.

- Okay. But can I at least share what the last M is and how these tools have helped me?

- Sure. Take it away.

- So the last M is manifesting. I was feeling super- stressed about school and, and then I started practicing the three M's every day after our training. And now - I still get scared sometimes - but I have the tools to help me feel like myself again.

- Z Bunny! Oh, this makes my heart so happy. You know, the more we practice, the better life gets.

- Oh. Oh, Emily. - Yes? Can you remind me what meditation means?

- Sure.

- It would be my pleasure. So meditation is a stress-relieving tool. You can think of it as a tool to help you get better at all the things you love doing. It helps you to unlock your superpowers of kindness, creativity, and bravery. It can also help you feel less worried, less frustrated, so that you can be better at all the things you love doing, like sports or dancing or making art.

- Ah, yes. It's all coming back to me now.

- All right. Z, I love you, but I got to explain stress now. We can catch up later.

- Oh, this is one of my favorite parts. You are going to love this. All right. See you later, Emily.

- Bye. -Bye. - See ya.

- Oh, Z Bunny. He's the best. Alright, let's talk about stress. Now, you probably hear that word a lot, but what exactly is stress anyway? We, adults tend to get pretty stressed out, which is not so fun to be around. Like if your mom snaps at you, even if you didn't do anything wrong, or if your dad's yelling in traffic. Stress is the thing that keeps us from being our most awesome selves. Stress can make our brains feel fuzzy or our bodies tired, angry, and even sick. Can you imagine a time in your day where you feel stressed? Maybe something that makes you want to yell or something that makes you want to be alone in your room? When that happens, where in your body do you feel it? Let's take a moment now to close our eyes and remember where you experience worry or stress. Just noticing where in your body it happens for you. Some people feel a belly ache; some people get angry; some people feel nervous in their chest. Okay, when you're ready, you can slowly open the eyes. So bravo on being brave enough to remember where you feel these feelings. I know it's not the most fun.

- Stress makes me really forgetful. And that means I forget important things like my classes or homework.

- Stress makes you angry, makes it hard to think clearly.

- Stress keeps me from being my best self because it makes me have a negative mindset. Then I start thinking I can't do things that I'm totally capable of doing.

- When I get stressed, I tend to do things faster. And fast isn't always the best way.

- But here's the good news. As you start meditating, you're going to have less stress in your body, which is going to help you feel and perform even better. So why do our bodies react to stress? Now, when I first heard this story about why bodies react to stress in the way they do, it helped me to feel a lot less like a failure when I was getting nervous performing on Broadway and having trouble sleeping. So once upon a time, a long time ago when humans were hunters and gatherers, we lived in nature with all the wild animals. Now imagine being out in the woods, and out of nowhere a giant tiger jumps out at you, fangs out. Now what happens next is called fight or flight. And it is how your body is wired to help you fight off or run from the tiger. Now first, your tummy's going to flood with acid to shut down digestion because your body needs all its energy to fight the tiger or run away from the tiger. And that same acid that flooded into your tummy will then move into your skin. So if the tiger bites you, you don't taste very good. Now your vision will get narrow, so you aren't distracted. Your immune system, which is what keeps you healthy, will slow down because your body isn't so worried about you catching a cold if it has a big tiger to deal with. Now, even your bladder and your bowels may empty so you can be light on your feet if you need to run away from the tiger. This is why some people feel like they have to go to the bathroom right before a school presentation or a sports tryout. I call those the nervous poos. So these reactions are very useful if you have to deal with tigers all day. But in our modern world, our worries have changed. Now it's tests and homework and family and friends and siblings. And this is where things get interesting. Now, the stress reactions that used to keep us safe from tigers can get in the way of us feeling relaxed, happy, and being the most amazing version of us. This is why so many modern-day heroes are using the three Ms of meditation, mindfulness, and manifesting to do great things in the world. Did you know that people like Ariana Grande, Steph Curry, and Emma Stone meditate? Olympic athletes, Super Bowl champions, and bestselling authors all use some of the very same tools you are about learn. And the best part? As you develop your daily Ziva practice, you're going to start to stress less and step into the full-blown superhero version of you. But to achieve anything great, you are going to have to do the work. There is one final thing you need to know as you start your training in the three Ms. This will not always be easy. There will be days that you love these exercises and days when you don't feel like doing it. When the tough feelings come up, do it anyway. Just like dance or soccer or video games, the more you do it, the better you get. The better you get, the more you enjoy it. And do you remember the very first time you rode your bike? It might have been hard or even scary, but after falling down and starting again and again, now riding a bike can be supereasy and fun. Same with Ziva. So if this sounds like something you are ready, willing, and able to do, I want you to commit, not for me, not for your parents, not for your teachers, but for you because you deserve the most amazing version of you. Now below you're going to find a pledge; right after this video, print it out; read it, and sign it. You can even ask someone to be your sponsor through this journey. 'cause every superhero needs a good sidekick. Now, we also created these cool badges of honor. So after each lesson you complete, you get a new badge, you can see all of your badges in your badge bungalow. Now I'm going to be here cheering you on and guiding you every step of the way. Here we go, you all.

- I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

Part 2: Lessons

========================================

Lesson 1: Ex-Squeeze Me?
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Yo, it's happening. You did it! Congratulations on taking the first step of the rest of your life.

- Congratulations,

- You did it! Now, I know that sounds dramatic, but it's true. There is no more valuable skill than to train your mind. Your mind is in charge of every decision you make and printing every single cell in your body. So this means that if your mind is stressed, it can make your body stressed. And if your mind is healthy and strong, it can make your body healthier and stronger. It's like the difference between having a hyperactive, jumpy puppy for a mind or a well-trained service dog. So today we are going to learn the first M of the three M's. Mindfulness, specifically a cool body scan to help you get out of your head and into your body. You know what? Let's try a quick one now. Hold up your right hand, and take a look at it. How does it feel? Can you put all of your attention on your pinky finger? And now look at your pointer finger, and put all of your attention there. Now make a fist, and squeeze it as tight as you can, squeezing every single muscle in your fist. And let it go. One more time, making a fist. Squeeze all the muscles in your hand as tight as you can, and let it go. And now notice how your right hand feels as opposed to your left hand. Feel the difference. Now, in a moment, we're going to do something similar with our whole bodies. But first a warning. This course is going to challenge you. Like anything awesome, you're going to have to put in the work; you have to commit. Again, not for your parents, not for your teachers, but for you. Now, there might be parts of this course that you enjoy, and there might be parts of this technique that you love. And if that is the case, awesome. Woo. But I am not that interested in how much you like this course or even if you like the techniques. What I'm interested in is helping you get better at the things you love doing. I'm interested in giving you the keys to your own mind to unlock your superpowers. Things like kindness, creativity, and bravery. So look, all these things are already inside of you, but it's hard to access them if your jumpy puppy minds are busy worrying about school and siblings and socializing. Okay, so to get started, get out your journal and something to write with. Oh, I have a lot of confetti on me. Okay, so grab your journal, something to write with, and I want you to write down the top three things that you would love to be better at in your life. It could be school or sports or art. And you can be as specific as you like. Just three things that you would love to be better at.

- Three things I want to be better at are football, golf, and I like art. So I would like to be better at drawing.

- Meditation, dance, and flexibility.

- I'd like to fix the relationship with my brother. I'd like to be better at school, and I'd like to have more friends.

- Three top things I would like to get better at is, number one, I would like to get better at running really fast. Number two, I like to get better at knitting. And number three, I like to get better at jumping.

- Now, it might be hard to understand why sitting quietly in a chair could possibly help you be better at these three areas of your life, but that is exactly what you're going to learn over the next seven lessons. Now, I recommend you do one lesson a day for the next seven days, and then come back and repeat as often as you like. Each lesson, I'm going to teach you a new part of the Ziva technique until we have mastered the three Ms and start to practice it like a daily habit. Now, I'll also share the science behind what this is doing to your brain and body and why it is helping you to be the most amazing version of you. Now, we practice these tools not to be good at meditation, but so that we can be better at life. Now, I would define someone who's good at life as someone who is brave, creative, and kind. Now these are called qualities. Now sure, some people may have nice hair, big muscles, or cute clothes, but the qualities I'm talking about are the ones on the inside. Now you know that time at school when you felt so, so confident, or when you were really kind to someone who was having a bad day? Or have you ever come up with a cool solution to a tough problem? In my book, these are all the ways we can be everyday superheroes. So the less stressed you are, the easier it is to take brave, creative, and kind actions because your body and mind aren't worked up into fight- or-flight mode over daily demands. Now, there are so many unique ways to be good at life. Let's explore them now. Can you remember a time where you felt super? Perhaps you felt brave, or you felt creative, or you felt kind. What actions did you take that made you feel that way? Now, how would you define someone who's good at life? I invite you to grab that journal and something to write with or even a piece of paper. And write down three things that you love about someone you admire, your own personal hero. It could be your parent, your favorite athlete, or even a superhero. I'll write along with you. Z Bunny, where did you come from?

- Oh, yeah?

- I didn't know you were here. Um, I love you, but you're writing very loudly. - Oh.

- Can you write a little more quietly?

- Of course, Emily. - Okay.

- Okay. Did you write down three qualities you admire about someone? I invite you to save this somewhere safe because we're going to come back to these cool qualities later. All right, are you ready to learn your first tool?

- Ha, ha, ha! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

- Z Bunny, I love you, but they are concentrating and you my friend, are too adorable to not be distracting.

- Oh, why, thank you.

- You're welcome.

- Me and my adorableness will just be over there meditating.

- Okay. - Happy meditating.

- Happy meditating. I love you.

- I love you so much.

- I'm bringing my picture book.

- He's the best. Okay, so today we are going to learn something called Squeeze Me. It's a physical form of a body scan and a great way to check in on how you're feeling right now. Think of it like giving yourself a big hug. Alright, now take your hands, put them together, and start to rub them back and forth faster and faster and faster. Are you starting to feel some heat in your hands? It's pretty cool, right? So now this is energy, and we're going to take all of this energy, all of this heat, all this goodness, and we're going to put it back into our bodies. Like you're giving yourself a massage. You know, our bodies do so much for us, and this is a time to say thank you and a way to prepare for the first M of mindfulness. So now extend your left hand, and you're going to squeeze and release it with your right hand. So pressing and releasing all the way up to your shoulder. Really good. And now do the other side. Just squeeze and release. Squeeze and release. Imagining that your arm is like a tube of toothpaste, and you're squeezing everything up towards your heart. And once you finish with your first arm, you can change sides. So squeezing and releasing your fingers, your forearms, your elbows, your biceps, all the way up to your heart. And then the other side. So again, it's like you're giving your arms a hug. Really good. And now we're going to go to the top of our heads, pressing and releasing all the way down. You can even do your jaw. 'cause a lot of us hold our worries in our jaw. And now squeezing and releasing your neck, your shoulders, moving that energy towards your heart. And now we're going to do a belly massage. Really gentle, just saying "Thank you, belly." And if this makes you uncomfortable, if you're not into the belly part, you can just skip it. Just give yourself a little pat, just checking in, saying "Thank you belly; thank you for digesting all of my food." And now we're going to move that energy from our belly all the way up to our heart. And then do the same thing with our back; press and release. Moving everything towards your heart. You're doing awesome. And now we're going to move down to our feet. So you can start with your left foot, just pressing and releasing. You know, our feet do so much for us, saying, "Thank you feet. You guys are awesome." You know every sport you've ever played, every dance you've ever danced has all been because of your feet. And then we're going to start moving up the legs, doing the calf. Imagining your whole leg is a giant tube of toothpaste, doing the front of the legs and then the back of the legs. Really good. And now we're going to switch to your other foot, just pressing and releasing like that giant tube of toothpaste, giving yourself a little massage. Once you've done the front of your leg, you can switch to the back of your leg. Pressing and releasing. Pressing, releasing. "Thank you, legs. Thank you, feet. Thank you, whole body." Really good. And now we can end with some gentle tapping. Just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap all over your body like you're giving yourself a hundred high fives, down to your feet, your thighs, your knees, your belly, your back, even up on your head, just waking up all the nerve endings in your body. Just a hundred high fives. Really good. Now let's take a moment; close the eyes, and check in on how you're feeling right now versus how you felt before we started the squeeze me exercise. Just noticing if there's any more blood flowing through your body; your skin might feel a little alive after those high fives. Just taking a moment before and after each exercise to notice what shifts for you. Really good. And when you are ready, in your own time, we can slowly open the eyes. Alright friends, Bravo. High five. You just completed lesson one of your superhero training.

- Congratulations! You did it! Yay.

- Now that means you've also unlocked your first badge of honor. Your first badge of honor is for bravery. It takes a lot of courage to start something new, and it takes even more courage to be willing to sit with yourself. And I want you to know that there are billions of adults who have never had the bravery that you are demonstrating by starting this journey. So know that I'm really proud of you. Alright, you can check out your new badge in your badge bungalow. Now. No homework for today. You already have plenty of that in your life. I recommend waiting until tomorrow to watch the next lesson. So I'll see you there. Bye friends.

- I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.


========================================

Lesson 2: Take 2x Breath
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Welcome back, friends. I am proud of you for coming back, for making good on your pledge so far. This is how we build new healthy habits and move towards the superhero version of you. Now, at the end of today's video, a reminder that you are going to unlock a brand new badge of honor. So stay tuned to find out which badge it is. Pop quiz time. And don't worry, there aren't any grades here. What was the name of the physical body scan we learned in the last lesson? It's something you do to a tube of toothpaste. Was it A Shake it off? B, Squeeze Me? Or C, Peel Me?

- B, Squeeze Me.

- That's right. B, Squeeze Me.

- Woo.

- Okay, so to know if you're getting better at life, it's important that you have a clear starting point so we can celebrate your progress together. So before we learn today's technique, I want you to print out the worksheet from today's lesson page. And if you don't have it, no worries. You can simply use your journal or a blank piece of paper, but it will be easier with the worksheet. Okay? So go and grab it. I'll be here. Got it? Okay. Now I'm going to ask you six questions. And after I ask the question, you can answer by writing a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 next to the question. Or simply circle the number if you're using the worksheet. So 1 means not at all this week. A 5 is almost all the time this week. So first question: this week I spent a lot of time worrying about school and friends. So next to this question, you write a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; 1 is you don't spend any time worrying about it; 2 is not really. And 3 means you sometimes worry; 4 means you worry a lot. And 5 means you worry all the time about school and friends. Did you choose one of the numbers that describes you this week? Okay. Now we can move on to question two. I have a tough time falling asleep - 1 is not tough at all; 5 is really tough. Next question. I feel anxious about homework or tests. Again, 1 is not at all; 5 is really anxious. I feel like a loser - 1 is I don't feel like a loser at all. And 5 is I feel like a loser a lot of the time. I am nice to myself. So 1 is you're not nice to yourself at all, and 5 is you're really nice to yourself. And last one, I feel really angry this week. So 1 is not at all, and 5 is super duper angry. Now I invite you to spend a few minutes journaling about what's stressing you out or worrying you the most right now. And if you prefer to draw, you could draw what your emotions look like on the inside. You can press pause on the video and do it now. Or you can finish watching and do it after. Your choice, but I want you to be honest 'cause we're going to revisit these answers after you have a bit of meditation under your belt. And we're going to see what's shifting for you. Okay, so now that we've kind of stressed ourselves out, reminding ourselves of all of our worries, now would be a very good time to do our new squeeze me tool and give our bodies some love. Then, get ready for something new and supercool. After Squeeze Me, we're going to learn the 2x Breath, which is a simple but powerful mindfulness breathing exercise. Right. So let's take our hands; start to move them together, creating some heat. That heat is energy. And then we're going to put that energy back into our bodies. So start by extending your left hand, taking your right hand, and squeezing and releasing all the way up your arm. Like your arm is a tube of toothpaste. And then the other side, we're pressing and releasing everything toward our heart. Really good. Now the other side. "Thank you, arms. Thank you, hands; thank you, shoulders." Doing the other side. We're actually moving energy and blood back up towards your heart, and you're stimulating all the nerves in your body. Really good. Now we'll do our bellies. And again, if this is uncomfortable for you, you can skip it or just do a little belly pat, and then we'll move onto our back. Pressing and releasing. "Thank you, back. Thank you, back." And now we'll move down to our feet. So pressing and releasing, giving yourself a little foot massage. Be like, "Thank you, feet. Thank you, legs. Every dance, every sports move I've ever done is because of you." Doing the back of your legs. Really good. And now switching to the other side, pressing and releasing again, just like a tube of toothpaste, moving all the stress out of our body, waking up all of our nerve endings, moving towards your heart. Really good. And then we'll just give ourselves a hundred high fives. Waking up all those nerve endings. You could even beat your chest like Tarzan. Excellent. And now we're going to move on to the 2x Breath. So at Ziva, we don't need any fancy fingers. You don't have to sit in uncomfortable positions. All you need to do this is to have your back supported and your head free. So this 2x Breath is supersimple but also very powerful. It is powerful enough to stop anxiety in its tracks. So if you ever feel a knot in your belly before a test, or if your mom gets mad and you want to run away to your room, you could use the 2x Breath. Oh, and by the way, it's called 2x Breath because we are doubling the length of the exhale from the inhale. So if you lose count, just make sure your out breath is longer than your in breath. Really easy. So sit with your back supported, your head free, and we're going to breathe in through our nose for the count of two. And then we're going to exhale through our mouths for the count of four. Really good. Let's do it together. Inhale through the nose for two. Now exhale through your mouth for 1, 2, 3, 4. Really good. Inhaling through the nose for two and exhaling through your mouth for four. You're doing so awesome. Let's inhale through the nose, one, two, and we'll exhale through the mouth for 1, 2, 3, 4. You can close your eyes if you haven't already, and we'll do a few more, breathing right into your belly, in for two and out for four. And now we're going to double it, in through the nose for four and out through your mouth for eight. Really good. Breathing in through the nose for four and out for 8; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Really good. Keeping the eyes closed. And we'll do a few more on this inhale. Imagine your breath coming in through the base of your spine. And as you breathe in, imagine this breath filling up your belly and your chest. And then as you exhale for the count of eight, imagine sending your breath right out through the middle of your forehead. Really good. On the next inhale, you're imagining your breath coming in through the base of the spine. As you fill your lungs with breath, you're imagining this breath traveling all the way up your spine. And on this next exhale, we send our breath right out through the middle of our forehead. You guys are doing awesome, letting this be your biggest breath you've taken all day; breathing in, waking up your imagination, and picturing this breath coming in through the base of the spine, traveling all the way up your spine. And then we're going to send this breath and this energy right out through the middle of our foreheads for the count of eight. Really good. And now that we're done with the 2x Breath, we can keep the eyes closed and just let the breath be easy and natural. So we're not counting the breath; we're not stretching it out; we're just letting it be easy and natural. And keeping the eyes closed, I invite you to take a moment to notice how you're feeling now versus how you were feeling before the exercise. Now in the next lesson, this is where we're going to drop into the meditation. For now, you can start to move your hands, move your feet, and in your own time, whenever you're ready, we can start to slowly, gently open the eyes. All right, friends, high five. Okay, so why on earth would making your out breath longer than your in breath make you feel better? Now it all started with a frog. So a long time ago there was a scientist who studied frogs' brains and hearts. And in the middle of the night he had a dream about how to help the frog's heart relax. He got up; he went to his lab, and he discovered that by stimulating something called the vagus nerve, which is the superhighway between your brain and body, it produces a chemical that slows your heart down. And that is what we're doing when we double the length of the exhale from the inhale. We're helping our vagus nerve tell our heart to relax. And that's why the 2x Breath is such a great tool before tests or presentations or tough conversations.

- I love meditation because I think that it gives you such a beautiful opportunity to be your best self that other things maybe couldn't provide.

- What I love about meditation is probably the, the, like the bliss field that I get from it. Because I find that whenever I've been meditating for at least five minutes, sometimes it varies between how stressful the day is or like how tired I am when I get to that bliss feel, but just completely elsewhere. And that that's probably my favorite part.

- So get ready because in the next lesson we are going to take things to a whole new level. So far we've been doing mindfulness with the Squeeze Me and the 2x Breath, which help you to deal with your stress in the now. In the next lesson, we're going to start the meditation part, which helps to heal things in your body. Now the only thing you need to know to prepare is that despite what you may have been told, thoughts are not the enemy of meditation. You don't have to clear your mind or be a frozen statue. We are going to have so much fun. Alright, no homework today. And you just completed your second lesson.

- Yay!

- Which means that you unlocked your second badge of honor. This one is calm. 'Cause the more we learn to calm our jumpy puppy minds, the more we can focus and do all the cool things we want to do in life. Now so far, you have two badges, bravery and calm, and you can see how many you've earned in your badge bungalow section of your course. Alright friends, enjoy your life; enjoy your day. I'll see you in the next lesson.

- I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

========================================

Lesson 3: Let's Meditate
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Today's the day, all. We are about to kick things up to a whole new level.

- Hooray!

- So, so far we've been doing mindfulness, which helps you to focus. Today we're going to learn meditation, which is going to help you to let go. And after you practice, side effects may include being a lot nicer to yourself and feeling more creative. So one of my very favorite things to say is that we meditate to get good at life, not to get good at meditation. After all, no one cares if you're good at meditation, but everyone cares how good you are at life. And this type of meditation is likely different from anything you've done before. Like I said, you don't need fancy fingers; you don't need to be able to clear your mind. So please be easy on yourself as we start this. This is the time to be a beginner. Ziva is all about ease and effortlessness. Honestly, it feels more like chilling on the couch than what you might have seen as meditation on Snapchat or what your parents are doing. So hands up if you like to daydream. Now, if you have a hard time focusing or concentrating, you're going to love this because you don't have to focus or concentrate here. Pop quiz time. What was the name of the breathing technique we learned in the last lesson? Was it A, 2x Breath? B, Hyperventilating? Or C, Snoring?

- A, 2x Breath.

- That's right. A, 2x Breath.

- Woo. Now let's do a few 2x breaths to review what we learned in the last lesson and to prepare us for today's meditation. This time we're going to add movement. So to start, just have a seat with your back supported, your head free, and take a moment to check in with yourself, noticing how you feel now. And to start, we're going to breathe in through the nose for the count of two. Exhale through your mouth for the count of four. Really good. Inhaling through the nose for two and exhaling through the mouth for four. Now we're going to add some movement. So as you inhale, just take your arms up overhead; let your hands clasp, and then bring them down as you exhale. Really good. Inhaling for two, letting your hands clasp overhead. And as you exhale, bringing your palms together at your chest. We'll do one final time, letting this be the biggest inhale you've taken all day, and exhaling, elongating your exhale from the inhale. Really good. I already feel a little bit better. How are you feeling? So what is the difference between mindfulness and meditation? So 2x Breath is a form of mindfulness. I would define mindfulness as the art of bringing your awareness into the present moment. Like if you're focusing on something. Now in the 2x Breath, we're focusing on counting our breath. In the Squeeze Me exercise, we're bringing our attention to different parts of the body. Now, these are good tools for handling your stress in the moment. What we're about to learn, the meditation portion of Ziva, is all about letting go. It's all about ease. And that's why I lovingly call it the lazy meditation. Now, this doesn't mean that you are a lazy person. It means that you get to be lazy when you do it instead of having to be focused. You want to see something cool? You take your hand and make a fist. And now let it go, and open your hand. Close it again, and make a fist. This is like focusing or mindfulness. Now, open your hand. This is like meditation. You want to have both skills: to be able to focus and to let go. And today we're learning to let go, to give your body deep healing rest. You already spend so much of your day having to focus and concentrate. Ziva is a time to let go and enjoy letting your mind wander. So look, the number one reason why most kids don't want to meditate is that they find it too boring. Fair point. But what if the thing that makes most meditation boring is the focusing? With Ziva, you're allowed to have thoughts. Also, did you know that your greatest ideas lie on the other side of boredom? Crazy, right? Have you ever noticed how you get awesome ideas in the shower? That's likely the only time you're not plugged in or having to focus for school. It's a time and a space just for thinking. What if meditation is like Googling your own brain to see what answers you can find inside of you? So Ziva really is like taking a shower for your brain. Sometimes you don't want to do it, but you always feel better afterwards, and you get to access your best ideas because you can hear those tiny little ideas, even when they're quiet little whispers. So this is not only a great tool for creativity; it can also help you if you're tired and need a boost. It can feel like a supercharged power nap sitting up but without the heaviness on the other side. Fun fact: this type of meditation can give your body rest that is five times deeper than sleep. Have you ever heard of Yoda? He's the one who trains Luke Skywalker to be a Jedi in Star Wars. And he says, "Do or do not. There is no try." It's the same with meditation. We simply meditate. We don't try. And no, this does not mean you have permission to not try your vegetables at dinner or not try something new. What it means is don't work too hard when you are meditating. Thoughts are not the enemy of Ziva. Effort is. And yes, your ears are still going to work even during this session. Sometimes you might even have Spidey senses when you're meditating, and you might be able to hear tiny little sounds around you. Now, sometimes you might feel a little sleepy, and your head might start to bob; all of this is totally normal. It is different from sleep, though. It's actually better than sleep. Now, before we get started with our first meditation, you are going to need to receive your mantra. Now I like to think of a mantra like an elevator, taking us deep inside ourselves, beyond the surface nagging thoughts of the mind, and down into the calm stillness of your inner self. This is where our true happiness lives. This is the source of your energy. This is the source of your creativity. So today I'm going to be asking you to close and open your eyes. Just go with it. After the next lesson, I won't be interrupting you anymore. So I'm about to give you your mantra. And once you receive it, you want to keep it on the inside, like your own special key. So no need to chant it out loud or write it down. And yes, we're going to review it in the next lesson. I'll have you say it with me a few times, and then we'll do it softer and softer and then silently. So before we start, we'll take one final slow 2x breath. So getting comfy in your chair. Big inhale through the nose, exhaling through the mouth. Really good. So your mantra is I am. I am. Let's say that softly together. I am, I am. I am. Letting it get softer and softer. I am. I am. Really good. And let's close the eyes and continue. I am. I am. And now, silently, without moving our tongue or our lips, just hearing it quietly in your mind. Slowly open the eyes. You feel like you have it? Please say it softly. One more time. I am. Really good. Now when we use it, we don't have to focus or say it clearly. It can be gentle like an echo. So let's close the eyes and continue with the mantra silently. So let's slowly open the eyes. It's easy. You feel a bit of relaxation? Good. This is meditation. So if at any point you seem to be forgetting the mantra, don't try to hold on; just let it go. It's okay to let your thoughts come and go. You're doing great. Let's close the eyes and continue. Let's open the eyes slowly. That's good? Relaxing? See how simple it is? Do you notice how sometimes thoughts come in, and the mantra slips away? How many times this happened? Two, three times, maybe a thousand times. It's good. We let the mantra come. We let the mantra go. We don't need to focus or concentrate. Now we're about to meditate for a few minutes, and you are doing an excellent job. There's no need to be a frozen statue. You can scratch your nose or move your legs if you need. Just comfort is key. Now know that the mantra may change in different ways. It might get faster, slower, louder, softer. It may appear to change, or it may not change at all. In any case, we take it as it comes. We let it be simple and natural. And one thing that's very important is that we don't try to meditate. We don't try to keep the tempo the same or change it. We don't resist noise or sounds. We simply take it as it comes, letting ourselves be easy and natural. Really good. So let's close our eyes and continue. You're doing great. Oh, let's keep the eyes closed, but we'll let go of the mantra inside. Imagine gently cutting the cord to an anchor so you can start to float back up to the surface. And as you do this, noticing how you're feeling. You might feel a bit floaty, or you might feel a bit emotional or heavy. All of this is totally normal. All of this is totally fine. We're just noticing where you are in this moment in time. Your head may feel a bit heavy during this. Your muscles might feel relaxed. You may even feel a bit sleepy. But know that this is different from sleep. When we're sleeping, our minds are resting, but our body is on guard. With meditation, our body is resting, but our mind is on guard. Just giving yourself permission to be exactly where you are, keeping the eyes closed, and letting yourself fully integrate. So you might notice that during this your breathing gets shallow, and your head might be heavy, but all the while your brain is alert and on guard. So it's the opposite of what you might have heard about meditation. You don't have to clear your mind, and you will likely be aware of your surroundings even though your body's getting rest. And we'll keep in mind that this deep rest of meditation is what helps us to develop our superpowers in the rest of our life, trusting that this will help us to be more creative, and it can help us if we're tired and need a boost. We can think of this like a supercharged power nap, where we're getting even deeper rest than sleep. Okay? So in your own time, when you are ready, we can start to slowly, gently open the eyes. Whew. All right, friends; gentle, post-meditation high five. You just did your very first Ziva meditation. So things are going to get easier and easier and make more sense as we go. But know that I am so proud of you. You are doing great. Now, before we wrap up, I have one final imagination exercise for you. Imagine your brain is a computer, and every time you've ever been stressed about homework or your friends or moving, it's left a window open on your brain computer. And if we had a million windows open, then the computer will crash. Your brain is the same. What meditation is doing is that it's closing down all those old stress windows so we can have more computing power for the fun stuff. We're taking the stress out of our brains and body so that we have more space for fun and creativity. The better your brain works, the better you work. Alright, friends, no homework for you, but do take note of your dreams if you have them. They might start to seem like scenes from a movie, or they might get a little weird and wild. Just enjoy. The most important thing is that you come back for the next lesson, as I have the very cool bubble diagram that you're going to want to see all the crazy scenes that can play out in your mind while you're meditating. Really good work today. Be gentle with yourself. It is just going to keep getting better and better. And you just unlocked your badge of honor for today. And the badge of honor is surrender. Surrender is the art of letting go and trusting. So as you do this process, let's let go, and let's trust ourselves. Alright, friends, I'll see you in the next lesson.

- I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

Lesson 4: Inside the Mind of a Meditator
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Back for more, eh? Good choice. See, you're already making great decisions, and you're only one day into the meditation portion. So today's lesson is the most important one in the whole course. So bravo on showing up for yourself. Pop quiz time. In the last lesson, you got your mantra. Do you remember what the word mantra means? Is it A, a mind vehicle, B, a mind popsicle, or C, a mind bender?

- A, mind vehicle.

- That's right. A. Mantra is a mind vehicle.

- Woo.

- Now, before we dive into today's meditation, I want to talk about elevators. Why elevators? Because this is a really helpful framework to understand why the mantra is so important and why thoughts during meditation are not the enemy. Effort is. So make sure to stick around after the meditation as we will dive deeper into this elevator concept. And I'm going to reveal the three things that happen in the mind of a meditator. And this is to help you feel less crazy when you're doing it on your own. Okay, so here's this bubble diagram. Now, when we start the meditation portion of Ziva, we start to think the mantra inside our mind. And in the beginning it's pretty clear; it's pretty pronounced. But remember, mantra means mind vehicle. So I like to imagine the mantra is an elevator taking the mind and body down so they can rest. So the mantra gets softer and quieter and teeny tiny until finally it does its little magic trick, and it just disappears. And we find ourself in this space between, with no thought and no mantra. Now think of this as the basement. It can feel a little dreamy, even sleepy. Now I like to call this basement the bliss field. So this part is the elevator taking you down, down, down to the bliss field. But as the body rests, it heals. And sometimes healing brings up all kinds of thoughts. Now these thoughts are like stops on the elevator. And when you're on the lower floors near the bliss field, the thoughts are teeny tiny. And then they might turn into dreamy thoughts or songs or memories. And then maybe you're remembering something you need to do. And then finally you're going to realize that you're off the mantra. You're going to realize that you're having a thought. All good. Your job then is to easily, gently float back to the mantra. Just like you can get off an elevator and get back on, the mantra might slip away, and you gently think it again. No feeling like a failure; no effort. Simply get back on the mantra elevator. Now, what I want you to take away from this bubble diagram is that the whole ride is meditation. The mantra is like the elevator taking you down, down, down. But eventually the elevator will take you back up, up, up. So pro tip: you won't necessarily know that you're down here in the bliss field when you are here. Now, if you do this in the morning, when you're rested, the elevator ride might happen really fast. You might feel more fidgety or active. If you do this when you're really tired, say like after school, then the ride might be a bit more slow and sleepy. Either way is great; one is deep, and the other is shallow. Now, one final tip before we meditate. If you start using effort with the mantra, trying to focus or force the mantra, then you may start to get headaches. The more effort you use, the less effective it is. The lazier you are with the mantra, the better it works. How awesome is this? What else in your life gets better the lazier you are? Alright, you ready to do this? We are going to put three pieces together. We're going to start with Squeeze Me, then we're going to do 2x Breath, and then, get ready, 'cause we are going to do a five-minute meditation. If you're a little nervous, it's okay. I'll be here cheering you on. So with Squeeze Me, let's take our hands, start to make some heat, make some energy. And then we're going to take this energy, and we're going to put it back into our bodies, giving ourselves some love and some hugs. I like to start by squeezing my left hand all the way up towards my heart. And then we do the other side, and then we switch hands saying, "Thank you, hands. Thank you, arms. Thank you, elbows. Thank you, shoulders," just pushing all the blood, all the energy, up towards your heart. Then we can do our head, squeezing and releasing, and even do a little bit of your jaw. A lot of people hold some worries and some tension in their jaw. Squeezing and releasing your neck; give yourself a little bit of a neck massage. And we can do our bellies. And if you don't like the belly massage, no worries. You can skip this part. Moving everything up towards your heart. And your lower back. And then we can go onto our left foot. If you're wearing shoes, you can start at your ankle, pressing and releasing, saying, "Thank you, feet. Thank you, calves; thank you, knees; thank you, thighs," all the way up to your hips. And then switching, doing your other foot, really just squeezing and releasing, having an attitude of gratitude the whole time. And we'll finish with our high fives. Start to give yourself a hundred high fives all over, waking up those nerve endings, getting the blood and energy into your body and out of our brains. Okay, really good. So now have a seat, with your back supported, your head free. And we'll inhale through the nose for two, and exhale through the mouth for four. This time we'll do our moving 2x breath. So inhaling for the count of two, bringing your hands overhead, letting your palms touch. And exhale for four as you bring your hands down. Really good. Inhaling. Big inhale as you take your arms overhead, letting your palms touch, and doubling the length of the exhale as you bring your palms down to your heart. One final time, biggest breath you've taken all day. And then breathing out, exhaling as you bring your palms down to your heart. Excellent. So now you can drop your hands into your lap. Closing the eyes. And remember that we don't try to meditate; we don't try to keep the tempo of the mantra the same, nor do we try to change it, and we don't concentrate or clear the mind. We don't have to block out sounds. We simply take it as it comes, letting this be nice and easy. So the mantra is simply, I am. I am. I am. I am. You don't have to say it out loud; you can simply hear it in your mind. Letting it get fainter and softer like that elevator is going down, down inside of yourself. And know that the mantra might slip away. That's okay. There's no need to hold on; when you realize that you're off, you gently float back to it. And we'll be here for a few minutes. Don't mind the time. I'll be here cheering you on. Giving yourself permission to be wherever you are. If your head gets heavy, if you feel sleepy, if your mind is racing, all of that is fine. Keeping the eyes closed while remembering that we don't have to be a frozen statue. If your nose itches, you can itch it. If you want to adjust your legs, it's all good. Letting yourself be easy and gentle. Let's keep the eyes closed, and we can let go of the mantra inside. We're allowing that elevator to leave the basement and come up to the higher floors as if we're gently cutting the cord to the mantra. As we take these few moments with our eyes closed after the meditation, it's a nice time to check in with yourself to notice how you are feeling on the inside now compared to how you felt before you started. It's important that we keep the eyes closed for a few moments after the meditation. If we open them too quickly, it can give us headaches. Taking a big inhale, keeping the eyes closed, starting to move your hands, move your feet, and in your own time, whenever you are feeling ready, we can start to slowly, gently open the eyes. Alright, friends, Bravo. That was no small feat. We just did five minutes of meditation. When in your whole life have you ever sat still for five minutes? I never did before I started meditating. So let's celebrate this huge success. You know, that means confetti time. Okay, before we end for today, we are going to dive deeper into this elevator analogy. And you're going to discover the top three things that happen inside the mind of a meditator. These three things will help you so much when you're practicing on your own. Okay, so the first is the party. This is when you have thoughts and mantra happening at the same time in your mind. The second is the bully. This is when you find yourself forcing the mantra. And the third is the bliss field. This is that sleepy, dreamy state I mentioned earlier. Think of it like the basement of the elevator. And it's a fun place to hang out, but it's not the goal. So we've got the party, the bully, and the bliss field. You can remember it like PBB.

- Did someone say PBB?

- I did.

- Peanut butter banana. That is one of my favorite snacks.

- Wait, Z bunny.

- First of all, where do you keep coming from?

- Over there. And second of all, I thought that carrots were your favorite snacks. Well, it depends on my mood.

- Oh. - Don't put me in your box of rabbit stereotypes, Emily.

- I am so sorry, Z bunny. I --

- It's okay. It's okay. I'm just kidding you.

- Okay. I didn't mean to offend you; I apologize.

- It's okay. Speaking of, though, I'm going to go get some PBB right now. Oh, will we bring me one? - Peanut butter banana.

- Some peanut butter banana snacks?

- You want some? - I would love some.

- I'm going to get you some. Okay. Alright. That's two PBBs.

- Okay, let's talk about this party. So the party is when you have thoughts and mantra happening at the same time. Let's say you start meditating; you're thinking your mantra a few times. You go down a few floors; the doors open, and there are your three best friends. They get on. Fun, right? Now you might start talking and having such a great time that you forget to push the button and ride the elevator. So when you realize you're off the mantra, you simply float back to it. AKA, push the button. Now you're riding your mantra elevator, and your friends, AKA, the thoughts that we enjoy, are there with you. Now the thoughts and mantra are there at the same time. All good. Now, you might think the mantra a few more times, go down a few more floors, and all of a sudden the doors open, and your three least favorite people from school are there. Now these thoughts are like how much homework you have to do or a fight you got into with a family member. And it might be tempting to want to close the doors or kick those thoughts out of the elevator. But your job is to be a good host of the party, not a bully. Everyone is allowed to join the elevator party. Now this is important. We all have unpleasant thoughts and feelings sometimes, and it might be tempting to use the mantra like a weapon, to push those unwanted thoughts and feelings away. Resist that urge. Let the uninvited guests be there in the midst of all this fun. Remember, your mantra is your guest of honor, and you are the host. So whether it's your happy vacation thoughts or your sad stressy thoughts, your job is to gently pay attention to the mantra. When you realize you're off, you easily just press the button, and everyone can enjoy the party in the elevator together. So the second thing that can happen in the mind of a meditator is the bully. So this is when we don't like the thoughts, we don't like the sounds happening around us, and we start using force or effort with the mantra. Now, you might have days where you're meditating with annoying noises, like your sibling around you. Noise is also allowed. You do not need complete silence in order to practice Ziva. But if you find the bully happening in your mind, it can look a little bit like this. Can you make this face with me, like the concentrating effort face? This is the forcing face. And if you are using effort with the mantra like a weapon to kick out all the uninvited guests, it can lead to headaches. Now if you notice this happening during the meditation, I recommend taking it a lot easier. Remember, this is the lazy meditation - for real. No need to concentrate or clear your mind. Simply let the mantra float in and float out. And finally, the bliss field. So this is the basement of the elevator ride. And as the elevator settles you down, every cell in your body starts to slow down. So you can move beyond your jumpy puppy mind and access your deep inner wisdom. And it might feel a little sleepy or dreamy. Time may pass quickly or slowly. You may not even know that you're there when you're there. Kind of like you don't know you're sleeping when you're sleeping; you only know before and after. And like I said, your head might start to bob a little bit. This is a classic move of Ziva meditators.

- This is great posture for us. You'll know you've fallen asleep if this happens...

- Now, while it's cool to hang out in a basement for a while, it is not the point of meditation. Remember, the point of meditation is to get better at life. So eventually we will ride that elevator back up, up, up. So that's it. You just learned the top three things that happen in the mind of a meditator: party, bully, bliss field. Or as Z Bunny reminded us, PBB. Now you are on a roll, my friends, and you just unlocked your next badge of honor. Today's badge of honor is ease. Ease means to make less difficult, to comfort your mind or body. We take it as it comes. Nice and easy.

- Easy like a Sunday morning. Ooooohh. easy, easy, easy like Sunday morning, the easiest Sunday morning ever. The easiest.

- Thank you. That's exactly how we meditate. Exactly like that. Thank you.

- You're welcome. I got to go. - Okay. - Okay, bye. -Bye.

- Love that guy. Okay. This was a lot to learn today. I'm so proud of you. You can revisit this lesson as many times as you like. No homework. Just notice how you're feeling and get excited because in the next lesson you are going to get to learn the third M manifesting. See you in the next lesson.

- I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

Lesson 5: It's Not Magic, It's Manifesting!
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Okay, today's lesson is juicy, you all. We are going to learn something called manifesting. And no it isn't magic, but sometimes it feels like it. So right now I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself kicking a soccer ball, seeing your foot making contact with the ball and the ball moving away from your foot. And now I invite you to imagine playing three keys on a piano. It doesn't matter if you've never played piano before. Just imagine touching 1, 2, 3 keys. Really good. And in your own time, you can start to open your eyes. Were you able to see anything in your mind? It's pretty cool, right?

- I use manifesting in my day by picturing now one day I'll be on Broadway. It makes me feel powerful, strong, and it gives me like a lot of hope for the future.

- I usually just imagine myself every single day being kind to my younger sisters.

- During my day, sometimes out on sunny walks, I think about what I want to be, and it's very clear.

- If I think how the day will be. But if it's going to be a bad day, it'll be a bad day. If it's going to be a good day, it'll be a good day.

- So you want to know something fascinating? Olympic athletes are trained in manifesting. Swimmers imagine their race before they dive in. Soccer stars visualize scoring the goal before the game begins. If you imagine something for long enough, it can change your brain, especially if you do the imagining after the meditation, when you've just taken the elevator ride down to the deep, quiet place inside. Now I'm going to share the science on manifesting after today's practice. But first, I would define manifesting as you creating a life you love. It's a chance to practice how you want to feel and who you want to be in challenging situations. This is programming your brain's GPS to where you want to go. Otherwise, we're simply wandering. Look, being a kid can be tough. Right now, there is so much in life that is not up to you. So many decisions that are made for you. But you know what you do get to choose? You get to choose how you respond to circumstances and what qualities you develop. Qualities like bravery, creativity, and kindness. This is up to you, and it gets easier and easier the longer you have a daily meditation practice. Now I'm really excited to lead you through the manifesting portion after we do the other two Ms. So we're going to begin with a quick Squeeze Me. Then we'll do the 2x Breath and a five-minute meditation. Because manifesting is so much more powerful when you do it right after the meditation. So let's take our hands, place them together, create some heat and some energy. And we'll start with Squeeze Me. And look, I know this might feel or look a little silly, and you don't have to do this if there are other people around. But the reason why we start with Squeeze Me is that you're bringing your energy, you're bringing your awareness out of your brain and into your body. You're actually starting to bring more blood out of your brain and into your body. When we spend our whole days thinking and wondering and worrying, we have a lot of energy, a lot of blood up in our brains. And so by doing this, we move this energy down into our bodies. We get out of worry, which happens in our minds, and into wonder, which happens in our bodies. So pressing and releasing, imagining your whole body is like a tube of toothpaste. Switching to your other leg, just saying "Thank you, feet. Thank you, calves; thank you, knees; thank you, thighs." And once you've done Squeeze Me all over the whole body, then we can do our high fives. Just patting down your body like you're giving yourself a million high fives. "Good job body." Even on your head. You could do this on your chest a little bit, like Tarzan, just waking up all the nerve endings in your body. Really good. So we'll do a few 2x breaths into our meditation, and then I'll lead you through the manifesting. So we'll breathe in through the nose for two and out through the mouth for four. Really good. Breathing in through the nose for 1, 2, and out through the mouth for 1, 2, 3, 4. And now we can double it. So inhaling for four and breathing out for eight, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Really good. And you can close your eyes if you haven't already, having a seat with your back supported and your head free. And we can gently float into the meditation. So we're hearing the mantra like a whisper in the background of the mind. We're not focusing or concentrating. You're allowed to have thoughts. You're allowed to hear noises. When you notice that you've gotten off on a floor on the elevator, you simply get back onto the elevator by thinking the mantra ever so gently. Remembering that the mantra is I am. I am. I am. I am. Letting it get fainter and finer; let it get softer and softer until it slips away. Giving yourself permission to be right where you are. You may start to have a lot of thoughts; some of them you might enjoy; some of them you might not enjoy. Remember that your job is to be a good host at your meditation party, letting everyone be there. The fun thoughts, the stressy thoughts, knowing that your mantra is your guest of honor. Oh, let's keep the eyes closed. But we can let go of the mantra inside, as if we're gently letting go of the mantra anchor. Imagine riding that elevator back up, up. Now from this space of ease, of connection to yourself, I invite you to ask the question, how would you love to feel today? To help inspire you, think of one of your heroes. It could be an everyday hero or a superhero but someone that you admire. It could be your best friend, a teacher, a family member. There's no wrong or right answer here. What is a strength that you admire? Is it how much fun they are, how much they help people? Is it how they make you feel? These are called qualities. And again, there's no right or wrong answer here. You're simply thinking about what quality in this person do you enjoy the most. And now I invite you to remind yourself of that quality inside of you. If you can see it in someone else, it's because it already exists inside of you. So if your hero is really fun, think about all the ways that you are fun. If your hero is really brave, think about all the ways that you are brave. And as you remind yourself of this quality inside of you, I invite you to imagine the coming day. What challenges are coming up? What things are you looking forward to? Do you have any tests or projects or presentations, anything that you really want to show up as your most super you? And taking a moment to imagine these qualities like bravery or fun or caring inside of you. How does it feel to do your homework from a place of confidence, like Wonder Woman? Can you imagine taking a test, feeling so smart like Einstein? And what if you could socialize with as much friendliness as your dog? Let yourself imagine the super version of you simply saying, "I am" ...blank. Whatever this quality is, if it's bravery or kindness or creativity, just saying that to yourself now. "I am creative." "I am kind." "I am confident." Whatever it is for you, however you would love to feel today, just saying that as if it's already true. Because it is. Really good. Now let's take a big breath in, bringing our awareness into the room, starting to move your hands, move your feet, and in your own time, whenever you're feeling ready, we can start to slowly, gently open the eyes. Bravo friends, I'm proud of you for trying something new. Okay, would you like to hear some supercool science about manifesting? So there was a study done on two groups of people. One group practiced piano for hours a day. The other group didn't touch a piano, but they visualized playing in their mind. They spent their time doing mental rehearsal. Guess what? The people who didn't even touch a piano still changed their brains and could play even better than the people who touched the keys. Now don't get me wrong, I am not giving you permission to skip your music lessons or your sports practice. I am sharing the science behind why this stuff works. Think of this like a key that can unlock your superpowers. Now, if you were to visualize before your practice or your game, think about how much better you might be. Virtually every pro athlete, Olympian, and musician does this before a big performance. They use their minds to help them get to where they want to go, to be better at the things that they love most. Imagine your mind as a well- trained service animal instead of that overexcited, jumpy puppy pulling you on the leash. Alright friends, congratulations. You just learned the final M of the Ziva technique, and you unlocked your fifth badge of honor. Today's badge of honor is creativity. Creativity is the ability to invent new and original things. And by manifesting every day you are going to be able to invent new and original things.

- Congratulations!

- You did it!

- So in the next lesson, we're going to do the whole Ziva technique together again so that you feel ready to do it on your own. And we're going to talk about some of the challenges that might come up so that they don't surprise you. So your extra credit assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to do the Squeeze Me, the 2x Breath, and five minutes of meditation on your own. And soon you're going to unlock an audio of me guiding you through the whole thing. So if it feels a little shaky or you're not really sure, don't worry. It's going to get easier and easier. Alright, friends, three, M's down, zero to go. I am super duper proud of you. Only a few lessons left. You're doing great. I'll see you for the next one. Bye.

- I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

========================================

Lesson 6: Ziva Makes Your Brain Work Better
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Okay friends, it is the second to last day, and you are doing so great. I am ridiculously proud of you for sticking with this training. Pop quiz time. What does manifesting mean? A, you now have magic powers. B, you can make other people do what you want. C, mental rehearsal or imagining how you want to feel in your day.

- C, mental rehearsal.

- That's right, C, imagining how you want to feel in your day. Woo. You are rocking this training. So you all, thanks for getting real. Ziva is not the newest toy anymore, and we aren't quite finished. So this is the part of the journey where superheroes are made. Do you dedicate yourself, or do you quit? This is me cheering you on, saying, "Keep going." Go back to your pledge. Seven days may feel like forever right now, but if you give these few minutes a day to meditation, you can train your brain to help you get to where you want to go and help you feel how you want to feel in your life. You're so close to graduating, and once you have these skills, you will have them to take with you for life. So things might start to feel a little weird as some feelings start to come up and out. Stay the course. Life is so much better with less stress in your body. And look, anything worth having is going to challenge you. If this were easy, everyone would do it.

- First of all, I think I get stressed from school mostly, and stress affects me in like the physical way. How I feel is whenever I get really stressed out, I kind of get cramped; like my hands, I don't know what happens, but they just go like this and I can't really move.

- Stress to me, especially if I've been stressed for a long period of time, like a week, a month, forever, it shows up to me as a headache, and I feel tired and unmotivated, which isn't my typical behavior. Usually I'm very motivated to progress and get things done.

- And let's remember why some of your favorite artists and athletes are meditating: not because they feel like it or because it's easy or because they have extra time. They do it because they know the better their brain works, the better they work. So I'm curious, how have you been feeling since you started the meditation portion? Have you had any weird dreams and maybe some surprise tears? Have you had any moments where you felt supergrumpy? What about headaches or fogginess? Just take a moment now, and write down anything that's been coming up for you. Anything that might seem a little unusual. I remember when I first started meditating, 12 years ago, my sleep got a lot better right away. I didn't get sick for eight years, and I got a lot better at my job, which back then was singing and dancing on Broadway. But it was not all sunshine and roses. I also felt really sad sometimes. I felt foggy as my body and mind were healing and growing. And now that I've taught over 25,000 people to meditate, almost every single one of them had some sort of a release or a detox. So if some funky stuff is coming up for you, know that you are not alone, and there's no need to panic; it will pass. This is all totally normal. In fact, it can be a good sign that things are moving and healing. Think of it like this. Have you ever turned on a garden hose in the springtime? After a long winter, you could turn on the faucet and expect the fresh clean water to come streaming out. And what first comes out of the hose is dirt and earthworms and gunk. Well, the same thing can happen with meditation. We are tapping you into your own superpowers. We're tapping into the very source of energy, to the source of creativity. But we have to clean out the old gunky stuff first. So this might be the opposite of what you thought meditation was supposed to do for you. You may have wanted to be a little bliss bunny floating on a cloud of sunshine all day. But with Ziva, we are cleaning out the stress so that we can be a channel for bravery, a channel for creativity, a channel for kindness. So nothing is wrong with you if you're having some big feelings. Feeling leads to healing. As a matter of fact, I have a theme song that I teach my adults and it goes a little something like this. Z bunny, if you please...

- Yes, Emily.

- Ready for this song?

- Oh, my favorite.

- Better out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh. Better out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh. Better out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh. Better out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh. Better out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh. Better out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh.

- Take it home, Z Bunny. - out than in. Uh. Better out than in. Uhuh.

- So I know that song sounds ridiculous, but there will be a day where you are feeling sad or angry. And if you remember me and Z Bunny doing that nerdy song, it's going to make you laugh, and you're going to be glad you have it in your back pocket. So if during or after one of your meditations, some big feelings come up, you can think back to me and Z doing our silly little "better out than in" song. Also, if your parents or guardians are having a tough time understanding why meditation might be making your moods more intense for a while instead of less intense, invite them to watch this video with you again. It'll be helpful to have your sidekick understand the process of releasing stress that can happen in the beginning. You want to hear something really sweet? My high school boyfriend wrote me a song called "There's More Room on the Outside." He later went on to marry the woman who played Elsa in Frozen. So I think he knows a thing or two about how to let it go. Okay? So rather than feeling sad or worried about our negative feelings, we actually want to celebrate them because, that's right! Feeling leads to healing. We want to celebrate these feelings and this healing. So I find that when big feelings start coming up and out, in the meditation or life, it helps to have a sense of humor about them, to know that if you're feeling angry, you are not anger; you're having some angry feelings. If you're feeling sad, you are not sadness itself. You are awesome, and you're having some sad feelings. Both things can be true at the same time. So I like to name my emotions to help me take them less seriously, almost like my alter egos. So when I get really stressed, Susie Stress Box shows up, and she's all like, "Ah, when is this going to be over? When is everything happening?" And when one of my friends gets something that I wanted, then Jealous Judy shows up, and she's like, "Ew, why did she get that and I didn't? It's no fair." And when someone in my family makes me really mad, Ferocious Frankie shouts Billie Eilish songs at the top of her lungs. So if you had to name one of your emotions, what would you name it? Have any heavy feelings been coming up for you this week? What would be a funny name to give that feeling? Mopey Dick? Anxious Anastasia? Irritable Iris? Just have some fun with it, and see who wants to come out to play.

- A funny name for my stormy feelings would be Stormy Troopers.

- Jerome?

- Maybe, Mean Insides.

- Zeninky Popo.

- A funny name to give my stormy or heavy feelings is Hyde because in the movie "Jekyll and Hyde," it's like his alter ego is Hyde, and he's like evil, so, I thought that would be funny.

- So you can press pause in this video and take five minutes to draw what your character looks like. Or if you preferred words to drawing, feel free to write a few sentences about who this alter ego is and how they act and feel. This way, when big feelings come up and out, instead of being scared of them or bullying them out of your brain party, simply be a good and kind host. See that they are there, and feel them. In fact, treat them like a storm. As Maya Angelou says, "Every storm runs out of rain." Eventually you do run out of tears if you let yourself cry. And on the other side of tears is joy. Did you know that even on a cloudy day the sun is still shining in the sky? You simply have to move beyond the clouds in order to see it. Well, the same is true for you. Even if you're feeling sad or angry or scared, your happiness is still there deep inside of you. And meditation is the key that helps us to find it. Okay, that is plenty of talking. Thanks for sticking with me. Let's do our practice. Now, there will likely be some times where you're doing this with other people around, where you're in public, and you won't be able to do the physical activity. So today we're going to skip Squeeze Me. So you can think of today's version as your superstealth spy version that you can do in school or on the bus or before activities, and no one will even know. So we'll do the 2x Breath, into meditation, into the manifesting. So have a seat with your back supported, your head free. You can go ahead and close your eyes 'cause we won't be moving. And we'll inhale through the nose for two, exhaling through your mouth for four. Really good. Inhaling through the nose for two and exhaling through your mouth for four. This time, as you inhale, imagine that breath coming in through the base of the spine. As you fill your lungs, that breath is traveling all the way up the spine. And as you exhale, imagine sending that breath and energy right out through the middle of your forehead. So we're creating a cycle, a flow of energy. So on this next inhale, imagine that breath coming in through the base of the spine. As you fill your lungs, imagine sending this breath all the way up your spine. And as you breathe out, can you imagine sending that breath right out through the middle of your forehead, out into everything you want to create in your day? Really good. And when you come to the end of this exhale, you can keep your eyes closed; settle into the chair, and we'll move into the meditation. We'll do seven minutes for today. But no need to keep an eye on the time. Let yourself be easy and natural. So remember that we don't try to meditate. We don't try to think the mantra. We don't try to control our thoughts. We let ourselves be simple and natural. Simply hearing the phrase, I am. I am. Letting it get fainter and finer. And if it slips away, all good; let it slip away. There's no need to hold on. If you realize you're off the mantra, then you can gently float back to it, giving yourself full permission to be where you are. If your mind is racing, let it race. If you need to adjust your body, you can always move. It's giving yourself this time as a gift, as a time to recharge. It's a time to unlock your inner wisdom, your inner creativity. We spend so much attention looking outward, so enjoy this time to look inward. You're doing great. If your head feels heavy or you feel like you're falling into a sleepy feeling, just let your head drop. Give yourself permission to be sleepy. It's likely not sleep. You are likely letting go into meditation. Let's keep the eyes closed, but we'll let go of the mantra inside. I invite you to think of a hero of yours. It could be someone different than the last time, someone in your real life or a superhero, your best friend or your biggest idol. Taking a moment to explore what it is that you admire about that person. What is it about how they make you feel? What is it about how they move through the world that you enjoy? And knowing that if you can see it in someone else, that means it already exists inside of you. So asking the question, "How would I love to feel today?" How would I love to feel... confident, happy, like I am enough fun. There's no right or wrong answer, just picking one thing that you want to play with for today, and just imagine that quality inside of you getting bigger and stronger. What actions would you take if you felt this way? How would you treat other people if you felt this way? How would you treat yourself if you felt this way? How much more fun would life be if you feel this way? How much easier are things when you feel this way? Just playing the preview trailer of your day in your mind, imagine yourself moving through your day, feeling this beautiful way that you want to feel. Even letting that bring a smile to your face. And when you feel complete, when you feel ready, you can take a big inhale, starting to move your hands, move your feet, and in your own time, whenever you are ready, you can start to slowly, gently open the eyes. Congratulations; you did it. How do you feel? It's good to get into the habit of checking in with yourself before and after each sitting so you can notice what shifts for you. Okay? So your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to do one Ziva session on your own before you watch Lesson 7. This is why I taught you the superstealth version today. So if you need to do it in public, you can skip the Squeeze Me, and you can skip the moving 2x Breath. Simply start with the still 2x Breath, then the meditation with your special mantra. And we end by imagining how you would love to feel today. And if you would like some guidance for your homework, then you, my friend, are in luck. Because you just completed Lesoon 6, you just unlocked a bonus audio of the whole Ziva technique. Now the next lesson, Lesson 7, is our last one, and it's a really important one. So all you have to do is show up, and I will take it from there. Good news, my friends, you just unlocked your next badge of honor. This one is commitment for demonstrating strong commitment to yourself and to your word. Alright friends, that's it. I'll see you for Lesson 7.

- Goodbye. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

========================================

Lesson 7: Take Your Brain to the Gym
--------------------

- I woke up this morning, threw on my cape. I took a look in the mirror, knew I was great. I told a superhero all I could see. Still I felt stormies up inside of me. I'm going to shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. Shake, shake, shake it out, baby. I'm going to be brave. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be bigger than my fear. I'm going to be kind. I'm going to be sweet. I'm going to be everything I dream. I'm going be strong. I'm going to be great. I'm going to use power to create the world that I want, the world that I need, the world that I know is inside of me. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

- Ah,

- Here we are. Lesson 7. You are clearly ready to step into your full superhero status.

- Yay!

- Listen, there are lots of kids whose parents wanted them to start this course. Only the really brave said yes. Of those who started the course, only the dedicated finished. I hope you are so superproud of yourself for saying yes and for committing. Bravo on making good on your pledge to yourself. So today might be the last training video, but it's just the beginning of your new life as a meditator. And if you're feeling a little bit scared about doing this on your own, don't worry. You can use your new bonus audio of the full Ziva technique to help you make this a habit. Feel free to use the audio like training wheels for as long as you need until you're ready to fly solo and do this on your own, superhero style. Now you can come back to these training videos anytime you like. If you have a rough day in a few weeks, as some of the stress is coming up and out, I recommend watching Lesson 6 again. It's going to remind you that the detox is part of the healing process. Also, I recommend that you ask your sidekick, AKA your grownup, to set an alarm for you for two months from now. That would be a really good time to come back to your quiz from day two and celebrate your success and your growth, to notice how life changes after just a few months of your daily meditation. So between now and two months from now, just keep practicing every day. And in two months we'll check in with your body to see if this whole meditation thing is working for you and for your brain. Also, it's important to know that the benefits of this add up over time. Life just gets better and better the longer you practice. Ziva is not a quick fix. It's not like Tylenol to immediately stop a headache. It's more like exercise, like taking your brain to the gym. Just like with sports or a new skill, the longer you practice, the better you will get. The magic happens when you commit. Now you have done such an awesome job committing to these seven training videos. Now's the time to commit to your daily practice, and I'm about to share something really cool that's going to help you to do just that. But first, Pop Quiz time. What was the name that you gave your emotional alter egos? Mine are Susie Stress Box, Jealous Judy, and Ferocious Frankie. Did you do that exercise? Did you draw what those characters look like or write a few sentences about them? If not, you can always do it at the end of today's lesson. Now you can always change them or invent more, and they don't have to be just for the tough stuff. You can create a power posse of sorts. These are the cast of characters you want to embody when you want to show up as the most super version of you. Maybe Brave Brianna or Kind Kristin or Creative Christina. The point is to help you have a sense of humor about them. Okay, now let's talk about how to make this a daily habit. Something you look forward to and feel proud of yourself for doing. So hopefully at this point in your life, you wouldn't want to leave your house without brushing your teeth 'cause it's grotty for you, and it's not nice for the people around you. Well, same with meditation. Every day we get food in our teeth, so every day we want to brush them. Every day we're going to get worried. So every day we need to freshen up our brains with meditation. Now, Ziva goes into the category of your everyday activities, like brushing your teeth or sleeping. It is that important and that simple. Now, if you're up for it, I want to share with you a famous college lecture. It's called "The Ping Pong Balls and the Sand." And I know you might be a little young for a college lecture, but you are meditators now, which can increase your IQ by as much as 12 points. So let's see how you like it...Oh, perfect. Okay. So this lecture is meant to illustrate the importance of starting your day with the priorities. Things like good food, exercise, and sleep. And if you do that, then there's plenty of time for social media and complaining and video games. So watch this; we start our day with the priorities, which are the ping pong balls. And then we have plenty of time for everything else, for social media, for gossiping, for eating food that's not so good for us. But if we started our day with the priorities, then everything else fills up around it, and there's plenty of time for all of it. It all fits in perfectly. Now watch this. Now, if we don't start our day with the priorities, if we start it with watching TV or eating junk food or spending too much time on social media, then guess what? There's not enough time for the priorities. So if you wake up worried and tired and then get sucked into social media drama or video games, then it's going to be much harder to make time for the stuff that makes you feel your best. So just like eating, sleeping, and brushing your teeth, Ziva is now a ping pong ball. It goes into your day first. All right, let's do our full practice. Perfect. So we'll start with Squeeze Me; then we'll do our moving 2x Breath, into the meditation, into the manifesting. So the full kit and caboodle. Take your hands; start to make some heat, creating some energy and bringing that blood, that energy, that awareness, into the body with the Squeeze Me, all the while with an attitude of gratitude. "Thank you body." I know it's a tricky time of life. Our bodies are changing so much. It's easy to criticize them, to think of all the reasons why they're not good enough. But this is a really important time where you can just say, "Hey, I appreciate you. I accept you. I love you, body, exactly as you are." Just treating your whole body like a tube of toothpaste, bringing things up towards your heart, press and release; press and release. Really good. And once you've given your whole body a hug, we can do our high fives. Just tapping it out, waking up all these nerve endings in our body. Can even pound on your chest a little bit, all down the head. And once you feel really alive, really ready, then we can settle in for the 2x Breath. So again, all we're doing is doubling the length of the exhale from the inhale. And this time we'll do a bit of movement. So as you inhale, take your arms overhead; clasp your palms together, and exhale for four as you bring your palms into your heart. Really good. Inhaling for the count of two and exhaling, bringing your palms down to your heart. Excellent. We'll do one more and exhale, beautiful. And drop your hands into your lap. You can close your eyes, and we'll settle into the meditation, reminding ourselves that we can be really simple, really gentle, really lazy with this. 'Cause this is a lazy meditation. So we don't have to try to meditate. We don't try to keep the tempo of the mantra the same, nor do we change it. We simply take it as it comes. If the mantra slips away, it's all good; we float back to it. If and when we realize that we're off, letting that elevator float down to the bliss field, letting it come back up, knowing that there will be invited guests and uninvited guests. Thoughts that you enjoy, thoughts that you don't enjoy. So thoughts that you enjoy, thoughts that you don't enjoy. All the while you're enjoying being a good host at your meditation party, knowing that thoughts are not the enemy. Effort is. Imagining the mantra as an elevator taking you deeper and deeper inside yourself. And if at any point it slips away, we let it slip away. You're doing great. If at any point you feel like you're falling into a sleepy feeling, give yourself permission to fall into that feeling. A reminder that it's likely not sleep. Otherwise you'd just fall out of the chair. Letting all the muscles in your body soften as you sink deeper inside yourself. So let's keep the eyes closed, and we'll let go of the mantra inside, gently cutting the cord to the mantra and allowing that elevator to come up from the basement. And from this place of connection, of groundedness, I invite you to ask the question, "How would I love to feel today?" How would I love to feel today? And the beautiful part about this question is that it doesn't matter what the answer was yesterday. It doesn't matter what the answer will be tomorrow. What matters is how you would love to feel to today. So simple; so powerful. This is an opportunity for you to design your life, to design your day. So thinking of the qualities inside of you that you would love to strengthen, imagining how it would feel to move through your day feeling this way, what actions would you take? How would you make the people around you feel? How much more fun would life be? How much easier would things get if you moved through life feeling this way? Then whatever came up for you, however you answered that question, "How would I love to feel today?" let's say it as if it's happening now. "I am..." Fill in the blank. "I am brave." "I am kind." "I am creative." Just seeing all the scenes play out from your day of you moving through your day feeling this way, like a preview trailer of your day. And when you feel complete with this, you can take a big inhale, start to move your hands, move your feet, and in your own time, whenever you're ready, we can start to slowly, gently open the eyes. We did it. We moved through the whole technique, and you've moved through almost the whole course. So as you feel ready, you can increase your meditation time to 10 minutes, if that feels good. Or you can feel free to stick with eight minutes, which is what we did today. It's really all about getting your tush on the cush. Now, don't let perfect be the enemy of good. That means that if you only have a few minutes, all good. If you miss a day or two, no stress. This is not about being a perfect meditator. This is about having a powerful tool to make friends with your mind, to ease anxiety so you can enjoy all the things you love about your life even more. And now, one final dorky song for my dear friend, Z Bunny. Z bunny, if you please.

- Oh, Emily. - Yes sir.

- Is it dorky song time?

- You guessed it. - I was hoping.

- Alright. Here we go. It goes a little something like this: Get your tush on the cush. Get your tush on the cush. Get your tush on the cush. Get your tush on the cush. Look at that tush. Get your tush on the cush. Get your tush on the cush. Get your tush on the cush...tush on the cush.

- Get your tush on the what? The cush.

- Tush on the cush. Yeah...

- Get your tush on the cush, on the cush and the tush on the cush and the... Okay, I'm going to go, that was the end of the song.

- Bye, Z Bunny. Oh, that guy. Okay, now, I recommend you put the answers to your quiz on day two somewhere safe, or even share them with your sidekick, and ask them to show you the answers in two months. You are going to be amazed at how much shifts in your life after just a few weeks of daily practice. Okay, we're coming to the end of our training, but this is not goodbye. I recommend you come back to these videos at least two to three more times. If you want a reminder or if you simply miss my silly songs with Z Bunny. Anytime you want to refresh your practice, you will hear something new each time. And you can always use the audio bonus if you enjoy my voice guiding you through. Now, my goal in this training is to give you the tools to do this on your own and unlock your superpowers inside of you. Okay, friends, now is the time to take your hats and throw them into the air. You have graduated!

- Double confetti! Congratulations! You did it! Congratulations! You did it!

- So look, as you heal yourself, you help to heal the world. Think about the global impact of this. Your superpowers are good for you, and they're also good for the world. So congratulations and bravo on your bravery, your commitment, your creativity, and your kindness to yourself. May this practice help you to grow into the person you dream of being, with the life you dream of having. You deserve it, and this is you claiming it. Alright, friends, your badge of honor for today is celebration 'cause I am celebrating you for moving through this. I hope you're so proud of yourself; happy meditating, and I look forward to hearing about what shifts for you.

- Bye. I'm a superhero. I'm a superhero.

Meditation: Your Ziva Practice Audio
--------------------

Hi, friends. I’m Emily, and I want to say congratulations on completing so much of this Ziva training that you have unlocked this audio bonus. You can think of this audio like training wheels. This is to help you transition from the videos into doing this practice all the way on your own. And in the meantime, this audio will be great for you to listen to in the morning or after school or before bed, whenever you decide you want to do your daily Ziva practice. So to begin, find a comfortable place to sit, and we’ll start with our squeeze me exercise. So you can use your right hand, squeezing your left hand, moving everything towards your heart like toothpaste, doing both sides. Now switching to your right hand and your arm. All the while we’re saying thank you, thank you, thank you. Infusing gratitude into every single cell in our body. And we can move on to our belly and our back, pressing and releasing always moving towards the heart and now we’ll do the top of the head pressing and releasing your jaw your neck and shoulders giving them a little extra love because we spend so much time sitting and at computers and looking at cell phones and our neck and shoulders tend to take the weight of that so giving yourself some love saying thank you thank you thank you really good and now moving on to your left foot making your way up your leg. Thank you, feet. Thank you, legs. Moving on to the next leg. Thank you, knees. Thank you, calves. Thank you, hips. And when you feel like you’ve pressed and released your whole body, we can move into our high fives. We’re just tapping the body on your chest, on your arms, your belly, your back, all the way down your legs to your feet. Moving back up the insides and the outsides of your legs, back up your chest into the top of your head, waking up all the nerve endings, getting your circulation going, waking up any stagnant or blocked energy in the body so that you feel fully present in your body and alive. And now I invite you to lean back in your seat wherever you feel comfortable. If you’re in a chair or on a floor with a wall behind you or on a couch, just having our back supported and our head free. Go ahead and close the eyes if you haven’t already. And we’ll move into the two X breath. So you know what to do. We’re simply inhaling through the nose for two. Exhaling through your mouth for four. Again, inhaling into the belly for two. And exhaling for four. You can start to do this in your own time. The key is that we’re doubling the length of the exhale from the inhale. And with each exhale, you’re letting your brow soften, your jaw soften, your shoulders drop. Your belly goes soft. Your legs feel heavy in your seat. With each inhale, you’re breathing space into your belly, space around your heart. And as you exhale, all the muscles are softening. Stress is melting off of your body. Any worry, any self-doubt, any self-judgment. Just imagine it melting down through your body, washing away with this out-breath. And we’ll do one final breath, letting this be your biggest breath all day. And as you exhale, just letting any unnecessary tension melt from the top of your head all the way down through your shoulders, your chest, your belly, your thighs, your calves, your feet, and wash all the way into the floor. Really good. And from this space of presence, of awareness, we can gently drift into the meditation. The thing to remember is that thoughts are not the enemy. You’re allowed to have thoughts. We’re simply going to ride your mantra down like an anchor, giving your body deep, healing rest so that you can feel like your full superhero self on the other side. So letting your eyes be heavy, letting your body be soft, tuning your attention inward. And ever so gently, you can start to hear your mantra in the background of your mind. If you’re having lots of thoughts, that’s okay. Know that thoughts are not the enemy of Ziva. When your mind takes a mental field trip, we gently, easily come back to our beautiful anchoring sound. The phrase that you learned during the course, we’re riding that down like an elevator. You’re doing great. We’ll be here for a few moments. Don’t mind the time. I’ll bring you out. So keep the eyes closed, and we can let go of the mantra inside, imagining that that elevator is starting to come back up, up, up, almost like we’re cutting the cord to an anchor. And from this space of groundedness, I invite you to ask the question, how would I love to feel today? How would I love to feel today? Would I love to feel kind, would I love to feel creative, would I love to feel brave. Imagining your day, imagining any potential challenges, anything that’s making you feel stormy. And then asking the question, how would I love to feel? If I were to feel brave, how would that change my day? If I were to feel loving, what would that look like? And there’s no right or wrong answer here, but whatever’s coming up for you for today, you can always change it tomorrow. Let’s play the movie in our mind of how your day looks feeling this way. Imagine all the interactions with your family, how you perform at school while you’re waking up, this superpower inside of you. When you feel this beautiful way that you want to feel, how does that change your interactions with your friends, your siblings, your teachers? As you imagine yourself feeling this feeling in every single cell in your body, how does this change the way you show up for your activities, for your homework? How does it shift the way you interact with your family at dinner? Really good. And whatever feeling you chose for today, I invite you to say that out loud. Really good. I invite you to give yourself a big high five for taking this time for yourself, for taking this time to recharge your brain and your body, to tap into the superpowers that are already inside of you. May this be your best day yet, and I’ll see you next time for this beautiful practice together. I’m proud of you.
