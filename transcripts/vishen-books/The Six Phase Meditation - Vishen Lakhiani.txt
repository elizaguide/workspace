Preface
On September 19, 2019, several friends reached out with the follow-
ing messages:
Hey, congratulations, read about it in the press!
Y ou must be so proud.
How cool!
I’d just woken up. Wait, what?
I had absolutely no idea what they were congratulating me for. It 
was a totally average day for me, as was the day before. I sat up in bed 
in my then- apartment in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, meditated, made 
myself a protein shake, showered, and took an Uber to work.
But the messages kept coming.
It turned out that my name had appeared in the press that morn-
ing— in reference to winning the US Open.

Now don’t get ahead of yourself; I myself didn’t win squat.
But a Romanian- Canadian teen by the name of Bianca Andreescu 
had. Beating Serena Williams in a nail- biting tennis major, she’d 
claimed her first Grand Slam title, and the world had been celebrat -
ing her ever since.
Furthermore, the bubbly nineteen- year- old had wiped the floor 
with Serena in the most gracious, positive, gentle way possible. She’d 
shaken her hand and even apologized for her victory!
The press got wind of this and found both her talent and her ma-
turity fascinating, asking, quite simply, “How did you pull it off?”
Bianca allegedly smiled and responded, “Let me show you!”
That’s where I come into the story. She pulled out her phone and 
flashed them my first book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind.
I’d mentioned the Six Phase Meditation protocol in my first best-
seller, and since reading about it, Bianca had signed up for a seminar 
on the Six Phase to start using it strategically to improve her perfor -
mance and optimize her life. Every day she would visualize herself 
winning the US Open (a protocol you’ll learn in Phase 4). And look 
where it got her.
So will you too win the US Open upon finishing this book? Prob-
ably not. These chapters won’t cover how to win tennis matches. But 
what I can tell you is that you’ll learn to win at life, crushing the goals 
that are most important to you as an individual.
Bianca is one of the millions of people who use the Six Phase Med-
itation to feel and perform at their best and achieve the unimaginable.
She isn’t the only high- profile athlete who uses the Six Phase, ei -
ther. So does T ony Gonzalez, the NFL T op 100 Hall of Famer, who 
credits this meditation in multiple press articles. As does Reggie Jack-

son of the LA Clippers, as well as his entire family (you can watch 
interviews with all of these amazing folks on my Instagram @vishen).
But the Six Phase isn’t just for athletes. It’s used by artists, entre-
preneurs, musicians, singers, and Hollywood stars whose movies 
you’ve probably seen.
Take War & Leisure singer- songwriter Miguel, for instance. Bill-
board magazine wrote a fascinating article about Miguel’s meditation 
practice with his entire crew before major concerts, titled “Miguel 
Talks Connecting with Fans Through Meditation Before His Shows.” 
Which meditation? Billboard asked.
Miguel responded, “It is a six- phase guided meditation narrated 
by Vishen Lakhiani that traverses consciousness, gratitude, forgive -
ness, three- year aspirations, visualization of one’s perfect day, etc. . . . 
And the meditation lasts about 20 mins.”
The reason rock stars and athletes apply the Six Phase is because 
they instantly notice its effects. Whether the measure is audience ap-
plause or scoring more points, they all witness the same boost in 
performance.
Are you a world- famous athlete or artist? Maybe not. But do you 
have dreams and aspirations of what you want to bring to the world? 
Most probably, yes.
Even if you’ve never classed yourself as one before, you may well 
be an entrepreneur. You may well be a creative changemaker who’s 
been waiting for a lucky break.
Your success might not be as obvious as Bianca’s. As you go 
through your day, there won’t be a scoreboard and a referee watching 
your every move. Nor will there be a live audience, dancing and ap -
plauding your performance. But you’ll feel it. It may be the gradual

increase in sales that you notice first. Or perhaps you perceive that 
you’re beginning to operate more frequently from a state of total flow. 
Perhaps, when you come to the end of your day, you’re amazed at 
how much you got done with so little effort while still feeling fully 
energized. For many entrepreneurs and CEOs, the Six Phase Medita-
tion has become their most important daily practice.
Mark my words: by the end of this book you’ll have all the tools 
you need to live the best, most successful, happiest life yet. And the 
people around you will notice.
This is why I’m so excited to deliver this protocol to you.
So what actually is the Six Phase Meditation? Well, first off, it’s 
not a traditional meditation. Let’s dump that idea right here.
Rather, it’s a series of science- backed mental scripts that you run 
in your head to transform the way you think about yourself and the 
world.
But before I dive deeper into the six phases, let me tell you about 
how I got obsessed with the power of the human mind and ended up 
starting one of the world’s biggest companies in personal growth and 
human transformation— Mindvalley.
Bill Gates, Microsoft, and the Musty Sofa
You should know that I was never meant to be a meditation instruc-
tor. My life wasn’t destined to be “spiritual,” and I never for a second 
entertained the idea that one day I’d be writing bestselling books on 
the subject of human potential.
I was born in Malaysia and grew up in a huge Hindu family that 
held academia in the highest regard. If, like me, you have Indian im-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   12Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   12 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

migrant heritage, you’re familiar with the notion that you have four 
choices of career: you’ll be an engineer, a doctor, a lawyer, or a family 
failure. No more, no less.
I’ll always remember the way my grandfather looked at me as we 
were on a drive one Sunday afternoon. This was around the time Bill 
Gates had visited India, and it coincided with the month I was faced 
with the most important decision of my life so far: which subject to 
study at college.
Bill Gates’s face was everywhere, on every news channel, in every 
paper. Inspired by the radio station blasting from the speakers, my 
grandfather had a light bulb moment, one that would dictate my 
choices for the five years ahead of me.
“Vishen,” he said, looking me in the eyes with hope. “You must 
be rich like Bill Gates! You must know computers!”
As the teen with the taped- up glasses who’d struggled with self- 
esteem issues most of his life, it’s safe to say I was more than eager to 
prove myself. I moved to the United States in the summer of 1999 
and enrolled in the computer engineering program at the University 
of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It was one of the top five schools in the 
world for computer science at that time. After fully immersing myself 
in the American college culture (do I have to say more?) and graduat-
ing, I got my happily- ever- after. I landed the internship of my fami-
ly’s dreams: a role at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington.
That’s right. I worked for Bill Gates. But as you have probably 
guessed by now, I didn’t stick it out for all that long. I actually got 
myself fired on purpose. Here’s what went down.
Despite the family praise and the temporary sense of achieve -
ment, two months in, I was miserable.

I’d wake up in the morning and hit the snooze button. Again and 
again and again. Although I’d become “successful,” my soul was col-
lapsing in on itself with the monotony. I remember one time when 
Bill Gates invited all the new hires to his gorgeous mansion overlook-
ing Lake Washington. All my colleagues gathered around him and his 
BBQ grill as he served us freshly grilled burgers. There they were, 
beaming as they shook the hand of their hero. I was the only one at 
the gathering who couldn’t do it. I knew I didn’t belong. Bill was a 
gracious host and a brilliant man. But this world was not for me.
So I decided I was going to quit, but the sheer fear of disappoint-
ing my family was giving me cold sweats at night. I couldn’t just walk 
out of there. I’d have to make it look like it wasn’t my choice. So I 
hatched a plan to get myself fired.
I shut the doors of my office and played the game Age of Empires 
all day long until someone noticed. Low, I know. I got officially fired 
for “playing computer games during company hours.”
I then moved to Silicon Valley with stars in my eyes to earn some 
money doing something I actually enjoyed. I’d be an entrepreneur! 
Of what, I wasn’t sure, but I was filled with illogical optimism. I 
wholeheartedly believed I’d forge a successful career— I had to. And 
Silicon Valley was, to new computer science grads, what Hollywood 
was to aspiring actors. I was in the right place.
But my timing, in a word, sucked. A few months after I moved to 
Silicon Valley, the dot- com bubble burst. Fourteen thousand people 
in the area were laid off practically overnight in April 2001, the exact 
month I was trying to get my company off the ground. So good luck 
trying to shop around an idea in that environment. It was bad news 
for my ego. But it was even worse news for my bank balance.

Months of trying to launch this company had resulted in noth -
ing. I slowly ran out of funds and soon could barely afford rent.
T o reduce expenses, I moved a long way from the Valley and set-
tled in the college town of Berkeley, California. I had less than $2,000 
in my bank account and absolutely no job prospects.
Luckily, I found an accommodation option I could afford— a col-
lege student’s two- seater couch. Yep, I couldn’t even afford a room. 
But a college kid I met through some friends in a bar told me I could 
rent his couch for $200 a month.
“You had many . . . couch renters?” I asked nervously as I set my 
bags down and sat, cautiously, unsure as to whether it could take my 
weight. It was a very shady couch to say the least.
“Oh, yeah, dude. They just keep comin’. How do you think I’m 
paying my college bills?” He laughed.
I shared a polite smile. In the bag next to me was my life. All my 
belongings in the world. I was $30,000 in debt and I had burned 
through the initial seed money I had raised from the Bank of Dad 
and it wasn’t going to get much easier. Even with my computer engi-
neering degree and steadfast determination, I quickly realized I 
couldn’t just become an entrepreneur overnight, and that floral sofa 
wasn’t going to rent itself. I needed money, fast.
I had to give up my entrepreneurial dreams to get a job. But I 
couldn’t get hired anywhere. With the dot- com crash, jobs were 
scarcer than ever.
Every day I’d wake up with a stiff neck and fire out more copies 
of my resume more times than I care to remember, in the desperate 
hope that someone would eventually employ me. My life was a mess, 
and I was going nowhere fast.

Finally, after eight excruciating months of rejection and my pride 
on the floor, my luck turned around.
Through a connection, I was offered an opportunity to interview 
for a small startup selling case- management software to law firms. 
But the economy was still sore, and most companies were refusing to 
pay a base salary. I read through the offer email.
Oh, God.
It was a “dialing for dollars” job. Selling over the phone was my 
worst nightmare. I was a graduate of the prestigious University of 
Michigan College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 
for crying out loud.
And I was going to be one of those people. But what choice did I 
have? If I left the offer any longer, some other wannabe success story 
would take my place on that stained two- seater and I’d have to return 
home to Malaysia with my tail between my legs.
So I took the job.
My great responsibility was dialing the numbers of hundreds of 
lawyers around the United States in an attempt to convince them to 
buy our software to manage their firms. Each morning, I’d be as -
signed an area— say, San Antonio, T exas. After I’d inhaled some 
crappy cereal I’d walk to the San Francisco Public Library. Back sore 
from another sleepless night on my precious, musty sofa, I’d sit my -
self down for the long haul with the Yellow Pages for San Antonio. I’d 
grab a notepad and pen and write down all the names of all the at -
torneys in that area from A to Z. Then I’d start calling. All of them in 
sequence.
There I was, a Malaysian kid with the name Vishen Lakhiani in -

terrupting stone- faced attorneys in the middle of their busy days to 
sell them software. You can imagine how that went for me.
Phone- slamming, yelling, and f*ck- offs became my daily routine. 
But don’t forget that lawyers are usually pretty good with linguistics 
too. Many wouldn’t just settle for telling me to f*ck off . Oh, no. 
Many were powerfully poetic and imaginative about it. Their descrip-
tions involved all kinds of exciting medieval torture techniques using 
inanimate objects such as broom handles and chair legs. Their mono-
logues would haunt my dreams.
Stumbling onto the Most Important Lesson I 
Would Ever Learn
I was failing and I knew it. I’d somehow ended up in another job I 
hated, but this time for a fraction of the pay. The American Dream 
had chewed me up and spat me out again.
So I did what anyone would do in such a pitiful situation. I put 
my instant noodles to one side and turned to Google: the hottest, 
most magical new search engine at the time. We were all still mesmer-
ized by its ability to answer anything we tossed at it.
Why does my life suck?
Important and, yes, somewhat pessimistic. Seek and you shall 
find. Google gave me a host of reasons life sucked. I typed on.
Why do I hate my job?
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   17Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   17 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Once more, Google informed me about all the reasons people 
hate their jobs nowadays. It was very depressing.
Only 15% of the world’s one billion full- time workers are 
engaged at work. It is significantly better in the U.S., at around 
30% engaged, but this still means that roughly 70% of 
American workers aren’t engaged.
Wow. Well, at least it wasn’t just me. I kept scrolling.
A lot of the same stuff— life is hard, work makes it harder, and so on.
But then I saw something. Something that gave me the faint hope 
that there could be a solution.
Meditation Seminar for Work Performance, Los Angeles
Okay . . . 
Click.
The promises were pretty big. They claimed that people who took 
this class sell better and smarter, get more positive about their jobs, 
and achieve dramatic career advancement. Could meditation really 
help me accelerate my sales closing rate? I wondered. By this point, I had 
absolutely nothing to lose, and the only thing that would notice my 
absence was the crappy sofa I tossed and turned on every night.
I decided to take a chance and go. After all, if I didn’t like it, I 
could just slip out the back and return home.
After getting on a plane, spending the little money I had left on a 
motel, grabbing a cheap coffee, and showing up at that meditation 
class . . . what I saw in front of me was my worst nightmare.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   18Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   18 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

I was alone.
I was the only student in the room.
The facilitator shrugged her shoulders and told me to take a seat.
Fearing the worst, imagining how she was going to light some 
incense, surround me with crystals, and demand that I chant a New 
Age mantra, I sat nervously.
But it wasn’t as bad as I thought. T urns out, this meditation tech-
nique was relatively new, compared to practices that date back cen -
turies. What’s more, it was created by a meditation expert from 
T exas. His name was José Silva, and he aptly named the seminar 
“Silva Ultramind.” His scientific- spiritual gift to the world became 
hugely popular in the 1970s and ’80s, and now, I’d learn it all one-  
on- one.
Amanda (name- change), would be my guide. Amanda was in 
pharmaceutical sales, and let’s just say you could smell her salary a 
mile off. Smartly dressed, cool and collected with her designer glasses 
resting on the bridge of her nose, she broke the meditation stereotype 
instantly. Maybe I wouldn’t be slipping out the back after all.
She ran me through the entire Silva Ultramind System in a single 
workshop. In just one day, I had a good handle on how to access al -
tered states of mind through meditation.
José Silva’s legacy, I learned (he died in 1999), was teaching the 
world mental programming techniques that broke the mold of tradi-
tional passive meditation. It wasn’t about clearing your mind and 
forgetting your problems. Rather, it was about turning your prob -
lems into projects. You would learn specific mental scripts to program 
your mind just like you’d program a computer. You could erase bad 
habits, accelerate healing, and even manifest dreams. Silva called this 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   19Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   19 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

approach “active” meditation to distinguish it from more traditional 
“passive” approaches.
I left that seminar with the most peace I’d ever had in my life. I 
had no idea meditation could actually be that useful. Nor did I have 
any idea that there was about to be an exponential rise in interest in 
the scientific study of enhanced performance through meditation.
So I got myself back to San Francisco and started my own medita-
tion practice. I meditated every single day from then on (pretty ob -
sessively, granted), using all the techniques Amanda showed me. If 
this didn’t work, I didn’t know where I’d get next month’s rent, so I 
really went for it.
I sat down every morning and visualized my sales doubling. I felt 
the excitement I’d feel in advance and I’d celebrate hitting my targets 
as if it were already a done deal. I breathed deep and connected to my 
newfound relationship with my gut feeling. I started listening quietly 
for inner guidance so I could use it at work.
One big change I made was deciding to no longer call lawyers in 
order of their Yellow Pages listing. Instead, I’d relax, go into my med-
itative state, tune into my intuition, and run my finger down those 
yellow pages; I’d stop when I got to a name that “felt” right. I would 
call on only those names. By the end of that first week, my closing 
rate doubled.
The meditation helped massively with my stress levels, too, so I 
was on the ball from the get- go. I used my newfound levels of energy 
and empathy to connect, properly, with whoever picked up that 
phone, which did wonders for my customer rapport. Guess what 
happened?
T wo weeks later, my sales had doubled again.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   20Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   20 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

And it didn’t stop there. I then brought in creative visualization 
using a technique called the mental screen (we’ll cover this in chap -
ter 4).
A month later, my sales doubled once more.
I went on to get promoted three times in the following four 
months. I made Vice- President of Sales. But that wasn’t enough for 
me. I asked the company founder if I could lead his nonexistent busi-
ness development division.
I was so good at my job that the founder of the company ended 
up giving me both positions. Vishen Lakhiani, twenty- six years old, 
VP of Sales and Business Development Manager.
My boss was thinking the same thing you are.
“How the hell are you doing this, Vishen?” he asked me, brow 
furrowed, arms crossed.
Meditation and intuition, I explained. There was a long pause.
“That’s bullshit . . . but can you keep doing it?”
The Inconvenient Side Effect of Meditation
I stayed at the company for eighteen more months, perfecting my 
meditation skills and landing an astronomical amount of sales. But 
within that time something had changed . . . 
Me.
You see, something somewhat inconvenient happens when you 
start to meditate.
You start to become a better person.
Your life becomes more than just a question mark over how to get 
rich and impress your parents. When you meditate on a regular basis, 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   21Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   21 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

your focus slowly shifts from your own ego to something more mean-
ingful. The most common but unexpected side effect of meditation is 
that you end up caring about humanity way more than you ever 
thought you could.
So after a couple of years in that software company, I felt a bit 
short- changed . . . spiritually speaking.
I was “successful,” but I became hyperaware, once again, that my 
job felt pretty void of true value. There had to be more to life than 
this. Who was I actually helping, for real? What would my legacy be? 
Call me a hippie, call me New Age, call me crazy . . . but I decided I 
was going to quit my generously paid work (again). But this time, I’d 
do something good for humanity.
If meditation had brought me this far, maybe I could rely on it to 
take me where I was meant to go.
So there I was at my computer a month later, contemplating my 
next big career change. I’d come to a block of the highest order: an 
existential crisis. Naturally, I did what any other person would do at 
a time like that.
I googled my question:
How do I change the world?
Pretty much straightaway I saw this quote:
If you want to change the world, change education.— Nelson 
Mandela
Wow. That was fast. Thanks, Nelson.

But what did I have to teach? Let’s be honest, computer engineer-
ing workshops wouldn’t put humanity into states of eternal bliss. 
What’s more, it had to be something I was passionate about. It had to 
be something that was missing from the education system.
Then it hit me.
My mind flashed to the scene in Los Angeles, with me alone in 
that meditation seminar room. That class had literally transformed 
me in a day. Why did the subject never come up in my $29,000- a- year 
degree at the University of Michigan? Why was I the only person 
who showed up? Where were meditation, intuition, and personal 
growth studies in the education system?
And the rest is history.
T o cut a long story short, I became a certified meditation instruc-
tor under the Silva Ultramind System and taught classes in London 
and New York for five years.
Several years later I founded my company, Mindvalley. And at 
Mindvalley, I’m proud to say we’ve managed to bring meditation to 
millions of people. T oday, Mindvalley is one of the biggest full- 
spectrum life learning companies in the world. We cover all the bases 
for what humans need for a rich life— mind, body, spirit, entrepre-
neurship, performance, relationship skills— and meditation runs 
right through the heart of it all. We’ve been voted one of the happiest 
workplaces on the planet because we practice what we preach. And at 
the time of writing this book, Mindvalley has become one of the 
most valuable personal growth companies in the world with over 
twenty million fans across the world and revenues approaching $100 
million.
Some call me lucky, and they’d be right. I just happened to meet

the right people at the right time, and I’ve been able to base my career 
on something I feel could change the world for the better. But it was 
all by design, and I thank meditation for getting me there.
There are, of course, hundreds of types of meditation. But what 
you’re about to learn in this book is how to practice a condensed, 
hyper- efficient, magic- making, joy- creating, productivity- inducing, 
goal- smashing mega meditation: the Six Phase Method.
I put the sequence together based on everything I’ve learned 
about meditation over twenty years, and it’s based on a vast amount 
of research and learning. I’ve been able to do this because I have a 
special advantage. Through Mindvalley I’ve interviewed and gotten 
to know over a thousand leading minds in human performance, spir-
ituality, and mind- set.
So what I’ve done is refine thousands of years’ worth of psycho -
spiritual wisdom, both the ancient and cutting- edge kinds, cherry- 
picked the best bits, translated it all into plain English, and put it in 
a logical order.
I ended up hacking meditation. Thousands of years of this- way- 
and- that- ing and overly complex scientific and spiritual research into 
one world- friendly, fifteen-  to twenty- minute practice— the Six Phase 
Meditation.

Introduction
I want to kick off this introduction with a statement that will prob -
ably confuse you.
I’m not a big fan of meditation.
Before you close this book and label me the hypocritical anti- 
Buddha, hear me out. Despite teaching “meditation” to millions of 
people, I feel that the word doesn’t quite hit the spot.
So although I named this sequence the Six Phase Meditation, and 
although you’ll read the word a thousand times throughout this 
book, it’s only because there isn’t another comprehensive word that 
encompasses the process any better. Or at least in a way that everyone 
is going to understand and/or resonate with. And, let’s be real, I’d like 
the people who are interested in finding some inner peace and living 
a better life to buy this book. From what I’ve seen, most people are 
googling how to practice meditation  as opposed to how to engage in 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   1Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   1 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

variable multifaceted psychospiritual transcendent mind- training tech-
niques.
 . . . so can you blame me?
“Meditation” is a snappier way to say it, but it’s too general, not 
to mention stigmatized. It’s like “exercise.” Exercise is the umbrella 
word for cardio, weight training, aerobics, yoga, swimming, hiking, 
trampolining, and even pole- dancing, just like meditation is an um-
brella word for a whole host of mental protocols. It’s very nuanced.
Similarly, just as so many people dislike the word exercise, which 
conjures images of spandex, sweat, and thigh chafing, a hell of a lot 
of people are instantly put off by the word meditation. But exercise 
can be so much more than Zumba, and meditation is so much more 
than mantras and incense.
Furthermore, those who exercise don’t have to be a size zero, and 
those who meditate don’t have to be prayer- bead- wearing New Age 
hippies who stare into everyone’s eyes for just a few seconds too many. 
(Although I myself have nothing against that; don’t get me wrong.)
More on this exercise analogy. Sure, Zumba is good for you, but 
if you want to build muscle mass on your arms, it’s probably not the 
best way to go about it. You’ll want to lift weights for that. So if, for 
example, you’re interested in meditation to quickly boost your levels 
of serotonin (the famous happiness chemical), you likely won’t get 
there by clearing your mind. Check out a gratitude meditation in -
stead. Want to feel loved- up and compassionate? There’s nothing like 
a little loving- kindness meditation. Looking to hit sales targets? T ry 
creative visualization. You get the idea. Radically different forms of 
meditation accomplish different things.
You really do have to be selective about your meditative style de-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   2Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   2 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

pending on where you’re at and what you want. And that’s exactly 
how I designed the six different phases; they’re deliciously cherry- 
picked from all the best meditative practices to shape the greater sum 
of your day- to- day human experience.
Meditation: Then and Now
One of the biggest mistakes people make when they try meditation 
for the first time is that they throw themselves into the deep end of a 
very old, very specific meditative technique with no prior training.
Consequently, they end up feeling crappy about themselves. They 
search for “guided meditation” on YouT ube to help calm their anxi-
ety, and they pick one randomly. A few seconds in, they get weirded 
out by the eerily breathy voice telling them to “just relax.”
They get distracted by the cheesy image on the screen and the an-
noyingly repetitive panpipes. They try to clear their mind but end up 
thinking about what’s for dinner. When the fifteen minutes are up, 
they’re more stressed than when they began. Why? Because they 
think they’re doing it wrong, and that their mind isn’t cut out for 
being still. They conclude that meditation can’t possibly be for them, 
so they never go back.
And why would they? If you went out on a Tinder date with some-
one who bored you to tears, looked nothing like they did on their 
pictures, and spent the entire time subtly shading you for how inept 
you were at dating, why the hell would you want to see them again?
That’s what happens with meditation. You’re told it’ll make you 
feel better, but it’s not what it’s cracked up to be. So f*ck you, Tinder 
date. And f*ck you, meditation.

I know this because I’ve been there. T rust me when I say that 
clearing your mind and focusing on your breath while adopting the 
lotus posture are not necessary in order to reap the real benefits of 
meditation.
For us to truly understand where we went so wrong with the in -
troduction of an ancient Asian practice to the West, it’s probably 
worth exploring its origins.
Meditation is ancient. It originated in India thousands of years 
back. And they were really into it. They dug it so much at the time 
that the practice was adopted by neighboring countries pretty fast. It 
spread like wildfire and formed a part of many religions we know 
today throughout the world, including Hinduism and Buddhism. 
They used it as a way to obtain peace of mind and connect to a higher 
truth. They used it to disconnect from saṃsāra, aka the physical 
world, in order to connect with their true selves. They used it to get 
enlightened.
But the way people used to meditate in India some three thou -
sand years ago is very different from how most of us need to meditate 
today.
T oday you don’t have the luxury of being able to escape your vil-
lage at a moment’s notice, find yourself a nice comfy cave, and stay 
there for six months if the going gets tough. T oday you can’t rely on 
your community to feed your kids while you’re away chanting om 
shanti. T oday you can’t just stick a note on your hut door saying, 
“Meditating somewhere in the mountains, dunno when I’ll be back!”
You can’t just check out. Not if you want to maintain healthy re-
lationships (not to mention a healthy bank balance). Life is different 
now.

That’s not to say you can’t reap the same benefits of meditation 
today that you would have a few thousand years ago. In fact, we need 
them now more than ever. Since 2012 the number of people practic-
ing meditation has tripled, and that’s both totally understandable and 
really positive.
But we’re kind of getting it wrong.
We’re missing the mark because we’re trying to replicate those 
monastic practices within the chaos that is modern life, then beating 
ourselves up when we fail. It’s like trying to fit a square peg into a 
round hole.
Remember that I opened this chapter by saying that I’m not a big 
fan of the word meditation? That’s why. Because when the modern- 
day human hears the word, they think of monastic practices. And it 
can ruin the entire process from the get- go.
I prefer to use the phrase transcendent practice. In essence, a tran-
scendent practice is any practice that takes you away from your phys-
ical outer world to make you go within. When I say “within,” I mean 
to tune out the physical world and attune your attention inward to 
the mind and soul. Which is important because we live in a world 
that’s actively trying to stop you from doing just that.
Why? Because there’s no profit in someone who has everything 
they need inside themselves, is there?
What Is the Six Phase Meditation?
The Six Phase Meditation is a transcendent fifteen-  to twenty- minute 
practice that I custom- designed to produce peak states in its practi -
tioners.

The Six Phase Meditation puts six of the most powerful mental- 
health- inducing practices into one unified approach for the modern 
human.
I invite you to download the Mindvalley app to aid you on your 
journey. Access to the Six Phase Meditation course is free with the 
purchase of this book. After you work your way through each chap -
ter, you can dive straight into the meditation audio for the phase you 
just learned about. In every audio, I’ll guide you carefully through 
the six phases. The book and the audio work together to lock in your 
meditation practice.
What I love the most about the Six Phase Meditation is that ev -
eryone and anyone can use it with ease. It’s simple and requires no 
special skills. But just like learning a martial art, where you practice a 
punch ten thousand times to get it perfect, the Six Phase shows you 
how to fine- tune each practice to perfection as long as you keep it up 
and dedicate yourself to going deeper.
We’ll dive into more details about each phase later on, but for 
now, know that with each session you’ll cover:
PHASE 1: The Circle of Love and Compassion
PHASE 2: Happiness and Gratitude
PHASE 3: Peace Through Forgiveness
PHASE 4: A Vision for Y our Future
PHASE 5: Mastering Y our Day
PHASE 6: The Blessing
While the Six Phase is fundamentally a “meditation” (although 
you know I’m not into that word), it’s heavily rooted in science and

personal study. You get all the benefits of meditation without the 
confusion, stress, and outdated rules that unfortunately come with it.
It’s basically a compilation of everything I’ve learned from inter -
viewing over a thousand leaders in the world of human potential and 
mind- set over two decades. It’s the best, easiest practice out there, and 
most people who try it really love it.
I know this because I’ve tested it on millions of people. There’s a 
reason athletes from every major US sports team, from the NBA to 
the NFL, are using it. There’s a reason that rock stars, entrepreneurs, 
Hollywood actors, and the world’s highest achievers are sitting down 
every morning and making the effort to slot it into their daily rou -
tines. Because, as you’ll see when you try it, the Six Phase isn’t just 
about spiritual centeredness (which of course you’ll get)— it’s all 
about performance, too.
It actively impacts the way you show up in the world, so you can 
help make it a better place.
So rock up in your PJs and join the club. No experience, prayer 
beads, vows of chastity, chanting, or incense necessary.
For Those Who Aren’t New to Meditation
I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard- core meditators 
out there. The ones who’ve studied traditional meditation for years, 
the ones who took out a loan to go find themselves in an ashram in 
India, the ones who are probably a bit pissed at me right now.
Please, don’t be.
Every single meditation you’ve done has been beneficial, and I 
don’t want to take any value away from that. We’re just approaching 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   7Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   7 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

the whole concept in a slightly different, updated way. I want you to 
know that you too are in exactly the right place. Because it’s my in -
tention to bring the Six Phase to billions of people, and for that, we 
must make the lingo and the technique tangible for everyone. No -
body gets left behind.
Complexity should never be confused with effectiveness. And the 
Six Phase is just that— it’s effective. It’s fully optimized. It’s a powerful 
mental training practice. And you don’t need a set of special medita-
tive skills to reap the countless benefits. So no, you don’t need to 
disappear off into the hills to attend a ten- day meditation retreat to 
find peace (although if that’s your thing, please continue to enjoy the 
respite— I like a nice retreat now and then too). You don’t need to 
force yourself into the lotus pose for a knee- wrenching hour- long ses-
sion. You just need fifteen to twenty minutes and a comfortable spot.
When it comes to meditation, the “longer the better” rule is a 
myth. With the right mental training, you can reap the same— and I 
repeat, the same— benefits in a fraction of the time.
The Minimum Effective Dose Model of 
Meditation and Exercise
The Six Phase Meditation is kind of like Tabata training. Ever heard 
of it?
Japanese scientists introduced Tabata to the world in the early 
2010s, and exercise has never been the same since for fitness junkies. 
Here’s the principle behind it: four minutes of intense exercise can 
induce the same benefits as an hour- long slower workout.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   8Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   8 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

It’s all about the minimum effective dose for maximum results.
Why spend an hour of your hectic day sweating miserably in a 
public class when four minutes at home will trim the same amount 
of belly fat? By the same token, why spend ten days (and all your 
expendable income) on a meditation retreat when you can access the 
Six Phase Meditation for free, and reap the same well- being?
Understanding the Six Phase Through a 1980s 
Computer Game
Most of us have played computer games before, right? As a kid who 
grew up in the ’80s, they were my life. One of the best was Rings of 
Zilfin.
I’d grab the floppy disc every day after school, and I’d transform 
into a tiny character called Reis who was jumping up and down with 
enthusiasm on the tiny screen of my clunky desktop. I had a very, 
very important job to do.
You see, long ago, the Zilfins (awesome wizard- ish people) built 
an enchanted realm of peace and abundance in the land of Batiniq. 
They created two rings of great power that, worn together, made the 
wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil Lord Dragos had found 
one of these rings, and with his impressive background in black 
magic, he’d tapped into crazy levels of power and started ransacking 
Batiniq. If he found the second ring, the universe was done for. Who 
was the one little guy who stood between Lord Dragos and world 
domination? Me.
My character, Reis, was a young boy presented with the task of 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   9Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   9 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

10
embarking on a noble quest to find the Zilfins (and the infamous 
second ring). Then and only then would he draw on his magical abil-
ities to kill Lord Dragos once and for all.
As the unassuming Reis, you had to travel through this funky ’80s 
computer land to pick up different magical skills along the way. Let’s 
face it, if you’re going to face the evil Lord Dragos and save the day, 
you’ll need some special powers. So you’d play, constantly upgrading 
different aspects of your character in preparation.
Reis had to level up his speed, his charisma, his weapons, his gold 
stash, and his spells to even stand a chance.
Now, as a twelve- year- old, this game was awesome . . . But I even-
tually got bored.
I was an impatient kid, and I just wanted to save Batiniq already, 
grab a chocolate milkshake to celebrate, and be done with it. So I 
hacked the game. My geeky younger self went about teaching himself 
computer programming in his spare time, figuring out which differ -
ent variables in the code were hackable so as to give Reis unlimited 
special abilities.
I ended up exponentially upping my character’s endurance. I tri-
pled the amount of gold I had in my sack just for fun. I quadrupled 
my strength. I tweaked my bow and arrow accuracy to perfection. 
And it goes without saying that I went ahead and upgraded my spar-
kling charisma by 30 percent, just in case some lovely virtual ladies 
happened to stroll by.
I then triumphantly proceeded to breeze through the levels, kill 
Lord Dragos, finish the game, and enjoy my chocolate milkshake.
As I grew older, a thought crossed my mind.
Could the Rings of Zilfin be a clever reflection of personal growth?
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   10Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   10 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

What applied to Reis applies to all of us in the real world. Just like 
Reis needed speed, spells, gold, and cutting- edge weapons to opti -
mize himself enough to win the quest, I figured that we needed to do 
the same in real life to stand a chance at thriving.
We, of course, need different skills to win in modern life (so you 
can go ahead and put down that axe).
How many?
You guessed it. Six.
We need all six elements of the Six Phase Meditation to win the 
ultimate prize of a deeply fulfilling life. That way, when we come to 
the end of our own game as human beings, we can do so feeling that 
we’ve succeeded in our quest.
In 2012 I made a simple framework, named it the Six Phase Med-
itation, and started using it every day to level myself up. When friends 
asked me to share it, I casually put it on YouT ube.
And then it blew up.
An Introduction to the Six Phase
As you can see, the Six Phase Meditation is another example of my 
hacking escapades, but this time it’s less about killing Lord Dragos 
and more about clearing the roadblocks between you and your best 
life.
With these six qualities, we become the most extraordinary ver -
sions of ourselves in the present moment. They also equip us with the 
tools we need for an awesome future. And without Lord Dragos, aka 
the pessimistic, stressed, closed minded voice pulling us down, there 
ain’t no stopping us now.

Just like Reis collected his superpowers, here are the ones you’ll 
collect along the way during the Six Phase Meditation:
Phase 1: Compassion
We accomplish this with a protocol for activating deep love and con-
nection. This is a hugely powerful tool. It won’t just level up your 
connection with yourself— it will enhance your relationships with 
others and the world itself. This protocol turns you into a kinder, 
nicer human being. All human beings need some love and compas -
sion in their lives (no matter how much they may deny it), so this is 
why the compassion category takes pride of place as the first official 
phase.
Phase 2: Gratitude
This will move your happiness bar up a level each time you practice. 
And the secret to happiness is gratitude. Gratitude is the ultimate 
remedy for the “lack mind- set,” taking precedence above all other 
mental training. It boosts energy, reduces anxiety, improves sleep, 
and, according to some studies, is the human characteristic most as -
sociated with feelings of well- being.
While it’s vital to have goals for the future, it’s just as vital to stop 
and appreciate what you’ve accomplished thus far.

Phase 3: Peace Through Forgiveness
This will take a huge weight off your shoulders and allow you to move 
on with your life as a stronger, better, more resilient person. Being at 
peace with the world and the people around you is one of the most 
effective ways to maintain blissipline (the discipline of protecting 
your bliss) as well as rendering you unf*ckwithable (more on this idea 
in chapter 3).
Forgiveness is a superpower. What’s more, research is now show-
ing that forgiveness can lead to unexpected and profound health ben-
efits, including reduced back pain, higher athletic performance, 
better heart health, and greater feelings of inner peace.
Phase 4: A Vision for Y our Future
It’s hugely energizing to have a vision pulling you forward— a picture 
of how you want your life to unfold. This phase will allow you to 
fine- tune your long- term goal- setting game plan and discover the vi-
sion for the life you truly want to live (and it will help you manifest 
it too).
In this phase, you learn how to apply visualization to craft an 
emotive, detailed vision of your future and to bring it into reality.
Phase 5: Mastering Y our Day
This will give you a sense of mastery over the day to come and help 
you achieve whatever you need to achieve. It also translates your fu -
ture dreams into actionable steps you can take immediately.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   13Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   13 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

When you see your perfect day unfolding, you’re priming your 
brain’s reticular activating system (RAS) to notice the upcoming pos-
itives as opposed to what could go wrong. But there’s also a powerful 
spiritual ideal in this practice that results in faster manifesting, luck, 
and synchronicity in your day- to- day life. More on this in chapter 5.
Phase 6: The Blessing
We attain this by connecting to a higher power. This will expand on 
your innermost feelings of being part of a benevolent universe, know-
ing you’re not alone and that life itself supports your goals.
You can reap the benefits of this final phase whether you’re spiri-
tual or not. If you believe that there is a higher power, you can call 
upon it and receive a blessing— a beautiful ending to complete the 
meditation. If you don’t believe in a higher power, you can imagine 
that you’re calling on your inner strength. That’s it, easy. It takes 
thirty seconds. It’s the cherry on top of an amazing experience.
The Art of Bending Reality: How Y our Present 
and Future Merge
The Six Phase Meditation is not randomly structured, as I mentioned 
earlier.
Some of you may have already noticed, but if you look at the six 
sections above, you’ll observe that the first three phases focus on your 
past and present, and the last three focus on your future.
The first three phases make up what I call your Pillar of Happi -
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   14Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   14 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

ness. There’s nothing like the practices of compassion, gratitude, and 
forgiveness to facilitate your joy in the now as well as liberate you 
from the chains of the past.
It’s these practices that facilitate your inner peace and allow you 
to tune in to a deep sense of wholeness. They allow you to break free 
from negativity and all that ties you to your prejudices.
But then there’s the second pillar. You absolutely need both pillars 
held up strong to live an optimal human experience.
Phases 4, 5, and 6 make up what I refer to as the Pillar of Vision. 
This pillar is made up of your deepest intuitive knowledge about 
where you want your life to go.
It’s about who you want to become, how you want to feel, what 
you want to achieve, what experiences you want to revel in, and what 
you want to contribute. It’s about what you want to leave behind 
when you’ve departed this world.
T ogether the six phases look like this:
 1. Compassion
 2. Gratitude } Pillar of Happiness
 3. Forgiveness
 4. Vision for Y our Future

Rockefeller Sr. wrote a poem that perfectly reflects what life feels like 
once you nail this notion of present- moment satisfaction and work-
ing toward your goals:
I was early taught to work as well as play;
My life has been one long, happy holiday— 
Full of work, and full of play— 
I dropped the worry on the way— 
And God was good to me every day.
— John D. Rockefeller Sr.
Sounds great, right? When you strike the balance between your 
Pillar of Happiness and your Pillar of Vision, you stumble on the 
secret of life itself— the secret that made Rockefeller one of the rich-
est men in human history. And I say “rich” in every sense of the word.
The problem is, very few people have two completely solid pillars, 
and they end up falling into traps that are pretty hard to get out of.

This heading looks like a weird twist on a C. S. Lewis novel, doesn’t 
it? But this part is key if you want to understand the importance of 
strengthening both of your life pillars in equal measure.

Low Happiness, Low Vision:  
The Negative Spiral
If you feel like you’re unsatisfied with your life as it is today, and don’t 
have a vision for the future, you’ll fall into the Negative Spiral. That’s 
the most dangerous state of all, unfortunately. It provides the perfect 
breeding ground for depression and apathy.

of Happiness, but unfortunately, they’ve abandoned their Pillar of 
Vision. Therefore, they bump up against the Current Reality T rap.
This, to me, is a trap because your happiness becomes fleeting. It 
fluctuates with whatever is happening in the now. But true fulfill -
ment is made up of both contentment and vision. It’s through having 
a vision that your happiness can benefit humanity in an ever- 
expanding way. Not knowing what you want to do with your life or 
what mark you want to leave on the world renders you a passenger in 
your own life. You’re at the mercy of the flow, and your state totally 
depends on the tide. You’re a piece of driftwood.
Granted, you’re a piece of generally contented driftwood, but a 
piece of driftwood all the same.
Low Happiness, High Vision:  
The Anxiety Corner
There’s another group of people who lack a strong Pillar of Happi -
ness, but what they do have is a vision. They might be unsatisfied 
right now, but they have a burning desire for change, for things to be 
different. It’s great that they’re motivated, but unfortunately, they 
often fall into the Anxiety Corner.
If you’re constantly focusing on the future and pinning your hap-
piness there, you’ll be chronically unhappy in the present. It’s called 
the paradox of intention. That’s because your intention to be happy 
is making you . . . unhappy.
And the irony of that is the unhappier you are and the lower the 
vibe of your everyday life, the less likely you are to achieve your goals.

Entrepreneurs who are always after that next big sale, students striv -
ing for those high grades, and exasperated singles searching for love 
are some of the best examples.
If only they knew that happiness in the present moment was the 
missing ingredient to skyrocket them toward their goals.
In psychologist Shawn Achor’s book The Happiness Advantage, he 
cites some incredible studies that prove how our levels of happiness 
dictate our performance.
According to Achor, happy people:
 1. Are much more likely to achieve their dreams
 2. Make for much better doctors, making diagnoses that are 19 
percent more accurate than the norm
 3. Make for incredible salespeople, landing 50 percent more sales 
than the average
 4. Perform better than unhappy students on academic examina-
tions
So there you have it— being happy in the present moment isn’t 
going to have any detrimental effects on your dreams. On the con -
trary.
When you’re both happy and appreciative of how life is right now 
(solidifying the Pillar of Happiness) and have a good plan for where 
you want your life to go in the future (constructing the Pillar of Vi -
sion), you graduate into the final category on the graph: Bending 
Reality.

High Happiness, High Vision: Bending Reality
I named this category Bending Reality because once you head into 
this arena, life molds itself in accordance with the person you’ve be -
come.
Picture this. You wake up every morning in a state of gratitude for 
how your life is right now, and your visions for the future pull you 
gently out of bed.
You’re aware of your mission, and every day you take steps toward 
achieving it while living fully in the present.
You contribute to the world, while simultaneously filling your 
own cup.
You’re proud of how far you’ve come and rest soundly at night 
knowing that it’s only up from here.
When you’re in this state, life feels different. Almost magical. 
You’re in flow— a state of heightened focus and awareness— and co-
incidences and synchronicity happen in abundance. The right people 
step into your life and the way you live life itself almost seems lucky. 
When you’re at this level, you cannot help but believe in something 
greater than the physical world— because magic is a daily part of your 
life.
But to get to this point, you’ve got to make sure your Pillar of Vi-
sion is just as strong as your Pillar of Happiness. And that’s where the 
Six Phase Meditation comes in.

Remember, This Meditation Isn’t About 
Meditation
For me, perfecting these practices as much as I can is my number one 
priority, not just in my meditative practices, but in my life. It’s thanks 
to the Six Phase Meditation that I have deep, intimate relationships 
with my loved ones and a career I’m proud of. It’s thanks to the Six 
Phase Meditation that I can say, hand on heart, that most of the time, 
I’m a pretty content person.
Because, as we’ve seen, meditation isn’t actually about the fifteen 
minutes you sit on your cushion. It’s about the real- life shifts for the 
better that you see in yourself when you get up.
None of us are perfect, and our flaws, as someone very close to me 
once observed, make us “flawsome.” So meditation isn’t about deny-
ing our shadow sides. What it does do is make you more aware of your 
inner jerk so you can notice it when it arises and attempts to wreak 
havoc on you and those around you.
Meditation, especially the Six Phase, keeps you accountable to the 
highest version of yourself. It keeps you on the straight and narrow 
path to your unique vision of the future, your dreams, your values, 
and your aspirations. In short, this meditation sequence, if I do say so 
myself . . . is frickin’ awesome beyond measure.
And I’m happy you’re about to reclaim it and reap the incredible 
benefits without striving for unrealistic mind- clearing.
Let’s address that last point.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   21Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   21 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Why Y ou Don’t Have to Clear Y our Mind During 
the Six Phase
Most meditation practices, in some way, focus on the goal of clearing, 
or at least quieting, the mind.
Now I don’t know about you, but I’ve always found that a little 
weird.
Sure, it can feel really good to press the pause button on relentless 
thought patterns; I’m not denying that. But as Mindvalley medita -
tion coach Emily Fletcher says, “Asking your mind to stop thinking 
is like asking your heart to stop beating.”
Thinking, in and of itself, is given a pretty bad rap in a lot of 
spiritual practices, and the ego is often demonized. But there’s noth-
ing wrong with you if you find your mind goes feral when you sit on 
your meditation cushion.
After all, there’s a reason ancient Buddhist scriptures depict the 
mind as “a drunken monkey jumping from branch to branch.” The 
mind is meant to be that way— that’s how it rolls. So while it pays to 
train your brain to calm down a little for your own well- being, there’s 
more than one way to go about it. And just instructing your mind to 
“stop thinking” isn’t going to cut it, is it?
That’s why the Six Phase Meditation is structured so compactly. 
As opposed to trying to block out thought, we’re harnessing the 
power of thought to access the true benefits of meditation. We’re not 
killing the monkey in a bid to find its bananas. We’re training it to 
harvest them for us. Get it?
Emily Fletcher continues:
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   22Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   22 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

If we understand that the point of meditation is to get good at 
life— not to get good at meditation— and if we accept the reality 
that no one can give their mind a command to stop, then it’s so 
much more innocent, so much more playful, and so much more 
enjoyable.
Now let’s get started.

How to Practice  
the Six Phase Meditation
Ready to hack yourself in the name of an optimal earthly experience?
Then the Six Phase Meditation awaits.
You can access it right now, for free, on the Mindvalley app, or the 
website (I’ll outline exactly how to do that in this section). One of the 
best things about this meditation, as I said at the beginning of this 
book, is that it’s suitable for absolutely everyone.
Nobody gets left behind or forgotten.
You don’t need any special skills, you don’t need any formal train-
ing, and you don’t need those prayer beads, for crying out loud.
In fact, let’s put the stereotypes to bed once and for all. I’m going 
to kick off this section with a list of things you absolutely do not need 
before becoming a “real” meditator.

All you need is your fine self. Got somewhere comfy to sit? Great. 
Got a brain? Great. Got about twenty minutes? Great. You’re ready.
When compared to a lot of dogmatized, monastic meditations 
out there, the Six Phase Meditation is pretty humble. And I made it 
that way on purpose. It really is unfortunate that the people who 
need meditation the most (stressed nine- to- fivers living in the hectic 
modern world) are turned off by the culture that often goes along 
with meditation.
If you like the prayer beads, incense, chanting, herbal tea 
selections— please, you do you. There’s absolutely nothing wrong 
with those practices at all. But what I want to hammer home here is 
that they’re not a prerequisite for meditation. Especially this one.
Let’s Start at the Very Beginning
 . . . a very good place to start.
1:  Forget Everything Y ou Think Y ou Know About 
Meditation
First things first— before you dive into your practice and get trans -
ported into heaven by my sweet, mellifluous voice— forget every -
thing you think you know about meditation.
One of the most valuable, lesser- known keys to squeezing the 
maximum juice out of any new experience is to start with a very open 
beginner’s mind- set.
So show up with a newbie attitude, even if you feel you’ve been 
there and done it when it comes to meditation. According to our 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   27Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   27 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Mindvalley brain expert, Jim Kwik, one of the biggest reasons people 
fail to embrace new information optimally is that they’re weighed 
down with prior “knowledge” about the subject. So when you press 
play on the Six Phase Meditation recording, do so without expecta -
tions of yourself.
2: Decide When Y ou’ll Start Practicing
Timing is everything— especially when it comes to meditation.
So the second thing to consider is when you’re going to start your 
practice.
If you ask me, the first thing in the morning is always best. There 
are a couple of reasons why.
First off, Phase 5 is all about planning your upcoming day, so if 
you’re practicing at eight o’clock in the evening, you haven’t got much 
of your “perfect day” left. What’s more, meditating in the morning 
sets you, and everyone else around you, up for a nice twenty- four 
hours. Stock up on compassion, gratitude, forgiveness, creative visu-
alization, and spiritual connection before you tuck into your morn -
ing omelet and you’re onto a winner, right?
Second, your brain is in a perfect state (the alpha frequency) for 
optimal meditative practices specifically upon awakening. We know 
this because our brain waves can be actively observed and charted 
using a machine called an electroencephalograph (aka an EEG ma -
chine).
When you begin to meditate later— say, in the afternoon— your 
brain has to shift from the everyday waking state (beta) to this resting 
state (alpha). And this can be quite difficult for newbies to do. But if 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   28Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   28 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
HOw TO PracTIce THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION 
29
you start first thing in the morning, you’re giving yourself a great leg 
up— because you’re naturally in alpha anyhow.
3: Give Y our Fellow Home Dwellers a Head’s Up
If you live alone, you can skip this bit. You have the unique setup for 
peace and tranquility at your fingertips, so being interrupted is not an 
issue.
But if, like me, you have kids, housemates, an affectionate spouse, 
or hyper pets, you don’t have that luxury. So I think it’s always a good 
idea to let whoever you live with know when and where you’ll be 
practicing and politely ask them (or beg them) not to disturb you.
Do what you have to do. Promise your kids you’ll play with them 
afterward or tell your spouse you’ll make them breakfast. Just as long 
as they treat the fifteen to twenty minutes you’re taking for yourself 
as sacred.
4: Decide Where Y ou’ll Practice
Then there’s the conundrum of where to practice your meditation. 
For me, I like to sit up in bed as soon as I wake up and meditate there. 
I cross my legs and shove a pillow behind my lower back, but again, 
you don’t have to. You can have your legs nice and straight with a 
cushion underneath your knees if you like.
As long as your spine is straight and comfortable and your head is 
free, you’re in a good position to meditate. Bed, chair, floor, wherever. 
At home is the best setting, but if you’re on the move, in a garden or 
park, or at the office, you can still make it work.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   29Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   29 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Just don’t lie down, because that’s a sure- fire way to snooze fifteen 
minutes into oblivion. That said, once all this becomes a habit for 
you, you’ll be way less likely to ever fall asleep while doing the Six 
Phase Meditation, even if you’re a bit tired. Your brain will come to 
know the difference between meditation time and nap time. So for 
now, just sit up nice and straight wherever you are.
5:  Grab Y our Phone and Open the Six Phase Meditation 
Audio
Now it’s time to enjoy the Six Phase Meditation in real time.
Have your cell phone close, and open the meditation to begin. I 
recommend treating yourself to some good- quality headphones so 
you can enjoy the best sound quality. Even better, you’ll get an extra 
special experience if you layer some binaural beats (two- tone audi-
tory illusions that occur when you hear different frequency sounds in 
the left and right ears) or relaxing music behind the track. All sound 
options are available for free in the app.
If you haven’t been using the actual meditation audio yet, here are 
a couple of ways to find it for free.
Option 1: The Mindvalley App
The Mindvalley app is by far the easiest and best way to access the Six 
Phase Meditation.
Just download the Mindvalley app, create an account, and click 
on the Programs tab at the bottom left.
You’ll find the entire Six Phase Meditation program, including 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   30Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   30 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

the lessons and the audios, for you to enjoy free of charge with this 
book. If you don’t see it straightaway, search for it at the top by typing 
in “Six Phase” in the search bar. When it appears, click on it to begin 
your journey.
If you’ve already completed the program and just want the Six 
Phase Meditation audio, go to the Meditations tab on the bottom 
right. You can search directly for it there by typing in “Six Phase” 
again.
Once you find it, click the heart icon to make it one of your fa -
vorites. That way, as soon as you click on the meditation tab on the 
app the next day, the Six Phase Meditation will appear automatically 
without your having to locate it in the folder.
Furthermore, you’ll bag yourself an entire collection of other re -
ally effective guided meditations and courses (including amazing 
free short courses for free such as The 3 Most Important Questions 
as well as more in- depth programs such as Silva Ultramind and Be 
Extraordinary— all will help you go even further down the rabbit 
hole of your potential after you’re done learning about the Six Phase). 
So go wild, there’s loads there for free (and for the courses that aren’t, 
you can unlock the entire collection with a Mindvalley member -
ship).
Option 2: The Mindvalley Website
If you don’t have a smartphone, all good. Go to the Mindvalley web-
site (www.mindvalley.com/sixphase) and sign up directly for the Six 
Phase Meditation program to access all the material I just mentioned. 
The audio is available throughout the course.

6: Take a Deep Breath and Follow My Lead
Now it’s time to begin the meditation. I’ll be guiding you through 
from start to finish, and you’ll navigate the process just fine because 
you’ve gone above and beyond by reading this book first.
Remember, you don’t have to already be in a space of calm and 
tranquility as soon as you start meditating. You’ll get there by the end 
of the recording, so just meet yourself where you’re at. Come as you 
are and enjoy.
It’s going to be a very special experience.
7: Bonus Step— Mid- meditation Movement
Please, don’t suffer through any form of discomfort during this med-
itation in the name of doing it “properly.”
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to sit still when you 
meditate. Sure, it aids concentration, but movement isn’t banned by 
any stretch of the imagination.
I know you’ve probably seen images from monasteries in India 
where holy men sit like statues all day, meditating in pure stillness. It 
really is a sight to see. Beautiful and unmoving, they render them -

selves oblivious to any weather, any sound, any insect that might land 
on their skin.
That to me, however, is a recipe for malaria.
Please, feel free to move when you need to. If your leg cramps up, 
stretch it. If your child falls over, pick them up. Do what you need to 
do, and then come straight back to it.
8: Bonus Step—  When Y our Thoughts Wander
The Six Phase is a gift for minds that wander.
If you’ve been meditating for a while and have explored the “not-
ing” style of meditation— the pure act of observing the mind and its 
stream of pondering— you’ll know that most of our thoughts orient 
around two things: problem solving and planning. That’s why the Six 
Phase Meditation addresses these elements of thought directly.
That’s a big reason Phase 3, forgiveness, is involved. If we’re angry 
at someone and we try to meditate, the mind will always return to 
how much of a jerk they are.
That’s survival mode, and it’s totally normal. If we’ve got an up -
coming event that we’re nervous about, the mind will want to focus 
on it to prepare for the worst- case scenario. That’s why Phase 4 and 
Phase 5 focus on forging a positive, optimistic plan for both the near 
and distant future.
See, the Six Phase Meditation doesn’t demonize thinking— it 
gives your thinking a fully optimized structure that draws on the 
power of the mind, ultimately improving your life for the long haul.

Another myth I’d love to debunk is of the musical kind.
You’ll find a lot of hard- core meditators who claim icy silence is 
the only backdrop that should accompany meditation.
But I disagree. Again, it’s like the lotus posture thing. If you’d 
prefer silence, if you prefer lotus, go ahead and do it that way. Every 
single meditator is different and has different preferences. There’s no 
right or wrong.
But I personally dig meditating with binaural beats in the back -
ground.
Why?
Because binaural beats have been proven to provide some pretty 
surprising benefits. They aren’t just some hokey tunes created by 
panpipe- playing yogis and singing whales. Binaural beats are created 
by a technology that plays two frequencies of sound— ideally, one in 
your left ear and one in your right, through some sexy headphones— 
that facilitate the practice of meditation by tuning your brain to their 
specific frequencies.
It sounds complex, but it’s not, really. I’m going to tell you about 
a lab in Phase 3, the forgiveness chapter, where they study your brain-
waves. It’s all measurable. Brain- wave frequencies reflect what state of 
mind you’re in, and binaural beats help take you from the active, 
waking, beta state to a more rested state like alpha. Sure, you can to-
tally get to that zenned- out, calm state of mind without binaural 
beats, but if they help, why not use them?

you can actually customize the background audio to suit you with 
binaural beats and a wealth of other soothing melodies.
There you have it. Now you know exactly how to practice the Six 
Phase Meditation.
Follow these steps, and you’ve set yourself up for a very produc -
tive session that will influence not only your upcoming day in a really 
positive way, but your entire life. And I believe wholeheartedly that 
the meditation doesn’t merely have the potential to change just your 
life, either. Rather, it’s got the potential to impact everyone else’s lives 
that are connected with yours as well. (I’ve got more to say on this in 
the closing word, so stay tuned).
It makes me happier than I can say to tell you that you’re about to 
join over a million other human beings who practice the Six Phase 
Meditation every day.
Welcome aboard.

Chapter 1
PHASE 1
The Circle of Love  
and Compassion
It is quite possible to lose one’s sense of being a separate self and  
to experience a kind of boundless, open awareness— to feel,  
in other words, at one with the cosmos.

Lift up your armpit and give it a whiff. Go on, seriously. I’m going 
somewhere with this.
What do you smell? Odds are, nothing too dramatic. In fact, 
you’re probably detecting something borderline pleasant— the smell 
of minty fresh deodorant, floral cologne, or remnants of the shower 
gel you used this morning. Or perhaps all you pick up on is the sweet, 
succulent scent of your own awesomeness.
But if I’d asked you to sniff yourself in the same way in 1920, 
you’d have probably fainted. Because a hundred years ago, bathing

wasn’t exactly a priority. Your breath would have reeked too. Did you 
know that in the early 1920s, only 7 percent of Americans bothered 
to brush their teeth?
That said, we’ve made quite a bit of progress in the last hundred 
years, haven’t we? Nowadays most of us are aware that hygiene is of 
the utmost importance. And when we shower and slap on some per-
fume, we’re not just doing it for ourselves— we’re also doing it in the 
name of other people’s olfactory delight.
So why is it that while billions of people rock up at work smelling 
like a jasmine flower, most of them haven’t given a second thought to 
their mental hygiene?
We wash our bodies daily. But we forget to wash our minds.
Many people, myself included, have woken up in the morning 
with feelings of anxiety, stress, or regrets from the day before. That’s 
okay, it’s human. But the problems arise when we choose to do noth-
ing about those feelings. Because just like a bad smell, those states of 
being will also undoubtedly impact other people.
Whether you want to consciously or not, you’re probably going 
to take out your frustrations on the world. When we’re lost in an 
ocean of our own baggage, compassion goes out the window. We’ve 
set ourselves up for a bad day along with anyone else in the firing line.
Compassion: The Benefits
Compassion trains your brain to be kinder. And trust me, in today’s 
world, kindness is a competitive advantage. But more on that later.
Compassion brings about an infectious bliss that touches every -
one we come into contact with. As well as feeling amazing while

you’re practicing, compassion also helps prevent unnecessary bad juju 
from ruining your day, never mind anyone else’s. Mountains sud -
denly don’t have to be made out of molehills, because you get that, 
really, there’s no difference between you and your fellow human 
being. With the practice of compassion, you’re able to see yourself in 
others, and therefore you can more easily let things slide.
Like when the waiter gets your order wrong. You know the feel -
ing. That sinking in your stomach, that oh for crying out loud  drama 
that goes off in your head when your steak isn’t cooked the way you 
requested . . . sure, it’s not the end of the world, but it’s just plain an-
noying. You’ll be damned if you give them a tip.
Now, I’m famously known as a great tipper. And that’s not be -
cause I have an addiction to polishing my halo. It all came about as 
an unexpected side effect of engaging in compassion practices.
A few months back during a respite between Covid- 19 lock -
downs, a friend and I decided to hit a local café. And that was excit-
ing because none of us had had the luxury of eating out in a long 
time. There was a queue of people just waiting to get in, and they 
were all happy to wait, smiling beneath their face coverings.
When we eventually were seated, I joyfully ordered a cup of coffee 
and a breakfast omelet with avocado from the waitress who ap -
proached our table.
T wenty minutes later, my coffee arrived. I took a sip. It was room 
temperature. And that, when you live in Northern Europe, means 
cold. My friend, fuming at this point, sat back and tutted as I calmly 
asked for a hot coffee. Apologetic, the waitress scurried off to make 
me a new one. Only she didn’t. She forgot.
Another thirty minutes later, my omelet was presented to me. But 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   39Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   39 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

the guacamole side was missing. My friend turned to me, half laugh-
ing, half angry, and whispered, “The service here is awful!”
We carried on eating what we were given. When we were ready to 
leave, I smiled at the waitress and left her a twenty- euro tip.
“Are you nuts?” my friend asked, creasing her brows. “The service 
was ridiculous; why on Earth would you give her twenty euros?!”
I’d not given it much thought. Granted, the service was pretty 
abysmal. But it was a hell of a lot better than being stuck at home on 
my own eating a microwaved meal. We’d not set foot outside for 
three months. This café was a godsend.
And that waitress? I didn’t resent her. I genuinely felt for her.
That waitress was probably jobless for those three months that we 
were all locked down. All the restaurants and bars were shut down. As 
well as being painfully lonely like the rest of us, she probably had the 
added worry of where her next paycheck was going to come from. 
Maybe she had kids like me.
Then when she finally landed this job, she was told that she had 
to wear a mask over her nose and mouth for ten hours straight in an 
overcrowded, stuffy café. She could see the line of twenty people out-
side that she’d have to wait on straight after us. They were totally 
understaffed and all she could do was her very best to keep on top of 
the endless stream of requests . . . all the while living with the uncer-
tainty as to whether she was going to lose her job, again, in the com-
ing weeks.
So frankly, from that perspective, she was doing a helluva job. 
And maybe that tip, if nothing else, could buy her a well- deserved 
bottle of wine or a box of chocolates to unwind with that evening.

Because if it wasn’t for people like her, working sporadically in hospi-
tality during a global pandemic, we’d all go mad.
I explained all this to my friend. I got a polite nod of affirmation 
before we headed out into the rest of our day.
What I didn’t tell him is that that very same morning, I’d com -
pleted the Six Phase Meditation. And it looked like Phase 1 had paid 
off.
That three- minute- long meditation had made me a less judgmen-
tal and more understanding person. The Buddhists would say I’d 
been injected with a shot of “loving- kindness”— the antidote to the 
human tendency of “attribution error.”
Fundamental Attribution Error: How We 
Misjudge Others and Make Excuses for 
Ourselves
You see, our brains are sneaky little self- glorifying devices that are 
precoded with this fundamental attribution error (an error that Phase 
1 will free you from).
Let’s say you’re driving and somebody cuts you off on the high -
way. In your mind, you’ll immediately blame them. You’ll scream, 
“What a jerk!” (hopefully in your head, not out the window). In other 
words, you assume they have a character flaw: they’re rude, arrogant, 
inconsiderate, and selfish.
But when you’re the one who cuts someone off, in your head 
you’ll go, “Oh God, sorry, sorry, sorry!” Whether it was an accident 
or not, you’ll justify it. You’re still getting used to your new car. You

were tired because you couldn’t sleep last night and you misjudged 
the space you had to overtake. You had to take your budgie to the vet. 
You had to get your daughter to school on time because it’s show- 
and- tell day and you didn’t want to let her down . . . fill in the blanks.
So when it’s someone else, it’s a character flaw. When it’s you, it’s 
just your unfortunate circumstances. You’re the gentle underdog of 
the story who just made a mistake.
I got called an asshole once.
I was twenty- four years old and I was running through an airport 
because I had literally four minutes to catch my flight to the most 
important conference of my life. I’d been working at the time for a 
nonprofit organization called AIESEC that focused on cultivating 
world peace. I got paid a pretty shitty salary, but its mission meant 
something to me, so I stayed. I’d chosen the cheapest flight I could to 
get to the conference, and lo and behold, they’d changed the time of 
my connecting flight.
So there I was, running as fast as I could, gasping for breath and 
desperately trying to lug my huge bag behind me. If I missed that 
flight, I didn’t know whether I could afford another, and I wasn’t 
about to charge a nonprofit for it. In my rush, I tripped over a guy’s 
suitcase. I got up and kept running, because every second counted.
As I soldiered on like a hero, I heard the words “ YOU ABSO-
LUTE ASSHOLE!” resonate through the airport corridor.
It was the guy whose baggage I’d tripped over.
And this perturbed me big- time. I’m genuinely not an asshole. 
I’m a nice guy. It was just an accident. But admittedly if someone had 
booted my bag without apologizing, I’d have probably thought the 
same thing about them.

There we have the fundamental attribution error again. I was an 
honest kid trying to catch a flight and save money because I worked 
for a nonprofit. But to the man who yelled at me, I was an inconsid-
erate ass who violated the peacefulness of his day. A young punk who 
kicked over his bag and kept running.
It was the same situation— but perceived from two opposite 
views.
Having a heightened sense of compassion dissolves that divide 
between “us” and “them.” Consequently, you end up getting trig -
gered a lot less because you understand that not everything is black 
and white. The perpetrator isn’t always a villain, and not everyone is 
out to get you. It’s not always a character flaw. Sometimes good peo-
ple make mistakes, just like you do.
We all have bad days. Having a bad day doesn’t make anyone a 
bad person.
But when those bad days with “bad behaviors” become chronic, 
that’s probably worth looking into. And starting your day with com-
passionate practices is a great place to start.
The Selfish Side of Compassion
Now I’ve got to be honest. I didn’t lovingly write the script of Phase 
1: The Circle of Love and Compassion from a place of complete self-
lessness. It wasn’t just out of the goodness of my innocent heart. Sure, 
it’s nice to be nice to other people. Sure, those around you will thank 
you for it. But there’s a more selfish side to compassion.
And if you can’t bring yourself to practice out of sheer uncondi -
tional love for humanity, that’s okay. Do it for you.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   43Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   43 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Because when you practice compassion, your emotional land -
scape gets a lot lighter, a lot happier, and a lot more balanced in the 
long term.
By inducing feelings of being more connected to everyone and 
everything, it goes without saying that you start seeing the world as a 
less threatening place. You start noticing how kind people can be. 
You begin to realize that the planet, with all its colorful inhabitants, 
is doing its best to work for you, not against you.
And science proves it. U Penn and U Illinois once did some in -
credible research on the effect of strong social connections on the 
human brain. Naming it “the Very Happy People Study,” the scien-
tists wanted to uncover the secret sauce behind profound Homo sapi-
ens well- being.
T urns out, the sauce wasn’t warm, sunny weather (although that 
helps). The sauce couldn’t be found at the bottom of an empty Krispy 
Kreme donut tray. The sauce wasn’t money, copious amounts of sex, 
or professional success.
The secret sauce was the strength of the participants’ social connec-
tions.
The consistently very, very happy people who stood head and 
shoulders above the rest were the ones who enjoyed deep romantic 
relationships, family ties, and friendships. Simple. But you’re not 
going to truly experience any of that without high levels of compas -
sion.
The more compassionate you are, the deeper, more solid, and har-
monious your relationships become. Compassion is the most valu -
able form of social currency there is. It’s downright powerful.

What Is Compassion, Anyway?
Compassion, contrary to popular belief, isn’t about feeling sorry for 
people.
It isn’t synonymous with sympathy. It’s all about loving connection 
with other beings, no matter who they are or where they’re from.
When Buddhist monks meditate on compassion, they’re not re -
flecting on all the woes of the world and chanting, “That’s too 
baaaaad.” They’re connecting to humanity and, sometimes, with the 
Earth itself. They’re feeling their place in it all and enjoying the one-
ness. They’re practicing being in a relationship with everyone so they 
can rock up in the world full of unconditional love and peace. Now 
that’s so much cooler than sympathy, isn’t it?
Sympathy is “poor you.” Compassion is “may you be well, fellow 
life form, because fundamentally, we’re one and the same.”
The difference is subtle but significant. Sympathy zaps your en -
ergy, and compassion boosts it. It’s no wonder why Buddhist monks 
always have an expression of superior serenity on their faces— they 
went and discovered the holy grail of compassion way before we did.
That said, countless twenty- first- century scientists are finally pay-
ing attention to the topic and studying it pretty vigorously. They too 
want to know what compassion is and if it’s really worth looking into.
Here’s the best definition of compassion that scientists have come 
up with so far:
Compassion is the act of moving from judgment to caring, from 
isolation to connection, from difference to understanding.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   45Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   45 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION MeTHOD
That’s an accurate description if you ask me. Something fascinat-
ing about compassion is that you can actually observe the caring, 
connection, and understanding in someone’s brain scan. Lit up like a 
Christmas tree, a loving- kindness- trained brain even looks different 
from a “normal” brain, exhibiting more capacity for effortless positiv-
ity. Compassion quite literally rewires the mind for the better.
For me, compassion is simple. Compassion is the act of surren -
dering to a better version of yourself. It’s about being warm and radi-
ating that warmth outward. It’s about genuinely caring about 
ourselves and other people.
As the great William Blake said, “We are put on earth a little 
space, that we might learn to bear the beams of love.”
So what are we waiting for?
The Challenges of Compassion
Now that you know a little more about the benefits of compassion 
you can reap for yourself and others, you might be questioning why 
more people aren’t talking about it.
Well, the way we’re living life right now doesn’t exactly set us up 
for success in the compassion department. Despite compassion’s 
being a natural side effect of being human (the vast majority of kids 
are born compassionate), society tends to train us out of it.
Let me prove it to you with an experiment.
Go look someone in the eye right now.
If you really want to challenge yourself, try to do this with some-
one you don’t know all that well. If you’re alone, go find a mirror and

Phase 1 : THe cIrcle Of lO ve aND cOMP aSSION 
look into your own eyes. I want you to hold that gaze, as steady as 
possible, for one minute.
How does it feel?
How uncomfortable does basic, primal, human connection feel 
for you? Rate it on a scale of 0 to 10.
If you live in the United States, Canada, Europe, or Australasia, 
you’ll probably feel especially uncomfortable. Because in those areas of 
the world, people are trained to believe that human connection should 
feel uncomfortable. You were probably told that it’s not polite to stare. 
Being stared at probably makes you feel extremely exposed and vul -
nerable. And that’s so damn sad. It’s not just a problem in those parts 
of the world, by the way. A surface- level connection culture has also 
spread to many other places in Asia, Africa, and South America.
But why is it like this? If the experience that most facilitates our 
fulfillment is socially defined as a rude, weird, and borderline painful 
activity . . . frankly, we’re all doomed. Some re- learning has to happen 
here.
That’s why compassion comes first in the Six Phase Meditation 
sequence. Because connection shouldn’t feel alien to us. It needs to be 
a strict priority in our lives.
Now I predict that 99 percent of you reading this book will have 
a question at this point. And your thought process may look some -
thing like this:
This compassion thing is all well and good, but what if someone 
is genuinely a jerk? What if I don’t want to have compassion for 
the spawn of Hitler?
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   47Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   47 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

I get it. I hear you. We all have at least one person we wish we 
could materialize away from the planet for one reason or another. 
That’s normal. And if this whole compassion idea isn’t hitting the 
spot with a particular person, that’s where Phase 3 comes in. It’s all 
about forgiveness, which is kind of like industrial- strength compas-
sion.
But for now, don’t worry about it. I’ll only ask you to concentrate 
on someone you love deeply and easily for Phase 1. I’ll talk you 
through the process at the end of this chapter.
So even though Phase 1 doesn’t focus on finding compassion for 
those who wrong us, it has actually helped me out in that sense too. 
Once I got into the swing of compassion, I wouldn’t automatically 
blow up when someone pissed me off. I’d know what I needed to do 
to come to peace, quickly. My practice of compassion allowed me to 
take the reins of my mental health and work better with fallible 
human beings.
It did wonders for my personal and professional relationships, as 
well as allowed me to feel at home in the world, connected to every-
one and everything in it.
The best thing is, you don’t really have to try. Once you start prac-
ticing the Six Phase Meditation on a regular basis, all this will happen 
on a subconscious level. It’s like passive income. The good stuff just 
keeps coming.

Training Y our Compassion “Muscles”
I know what you’re thinking. Surely you can’t become infinitely more 
compassionate and connected to the cosmos in a few measly minutes. 
Surely it’s not something you can just decide to learn. Compassion 
isn’t computer engineering, after all. There’s no Duolingo to help you 
speak Betterpersonish.
Compassion is a personality trait. You either are, or you’re not. 
You can’t just make the decision to adopt an enlightened human 
quality, right?
Wrong!
Professor Richard J. Davidson and his colossal team of scientists, 
psychologists, and test subjects at the University of Wisconsin– 
Madison would agree with me.
Because these awesome humans proved that compassion is, in 
fact, a trainable skill. They too wanted to reveal the truth behind the 
nature- nurture debate surrounding compassion. Could it be learned 
and implemented? Or did your DNA dictate whether you were des-
tined to be a reincarnation of Gandhi . . . or a bit of a jerk?
T o answer that question, the team went about creating an exten-
sive study on the qualities of compassion and kindness. They asked 
the participants to follow guided compassion meditations every day 
for two weeks. Done. No electric shocks, no pills, no pointy sticks or 
cages. The only responsibility the participants had was sitting back, 
relaxing, and cultivating feelings of compassion for different targets.
These targets included a loved one, themselves, a stranger, and 
someone they found difficult to be around. The scientists tracked 
their progress through regular brain scans.

Here’s what they discovered:
These results suggest that compassion can be cultivated with 
training, where greater altruistic behavior may emerge from 
increased engagement in neural systems implicated in 
understanding the suffering of others, executive and emotional 
control, and reward processing.
T o put that in plain English, what they found was that benevolent 
human qualities aren’t predetermined. Rather, they are trainable. You 
can coach your brain into kindness. You can program more compas-
sion into your kids. You can quite literally school yourself out of 
being a schmuck. Embracing a more compassionate version of your-
self is a choice you can make. And practice makes perfect.

throughout our lives. Their length, and the rate at which their length 
reduces, gives scientists a highly accurate indication of how old some-
one is as well as how fast they are aging.
So in this study, scientists compared the length of those telomeres 
in people who practiced loving- kindness compassion meditations 
versus those who didn’t. Incredibly, while telomere length was re -
duced for the nonmeditators, it did not shorten at all in the loving- 
kindness meditation group.
In other words, kindness and compassion slow aging at a genetic 
level. Crazy, isn’t it?
Here’s another very useful benefit of a compassion practice. If 
you’re a single man, listen up— because compassion might just help 
you land your next successful date.

Studies show that the single most attractive attribute in a man 
from the female perspective is kindness. And compassion is the root 
of kindness!
Ladies, you’re not left out here. A similar study showed that men 
also consistently rated women as more desirable if they embodied 
compassion to some degree. So despite their binary design, the stud-
ies demonstrate that the attractiveness of compassion is gender- 
neutral.
We’re all biologically wired to be drawn to people who are com -
passionate. Have you seen the hordes of people who assemble in front 
of the Dalai Lama just hoping to catch a mere glimpse of his loving 
gaze? We all want to be loved and understood, and compassion is the 
secret ingredient that makes the magic happen. Why wouldn’t we 
want to hang out with compassionate people?
Heart Resonance: The Health Indicator We 
Don’t Pay Enough Attention T o
I wanted to make Phase 1 more personal. I wanted to be able to actu-
ally see and feel my connection with the world, not just go through 
the mental motions. In my search for the perfect technique, I stum -
bled across the compassion protocols from the HeartMath Institute.
Based in California, the HeartMath Institute is home to passion-
ate scientists who are fascinated by a concept called “heart resonance.”
Your heart resonance is the timing between the beats of your 
heart, which correlates to your levels of loving connection. And you 
can measure it, develop it, and use it as a launchpad to feelings of 
overwhelming bliss.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   52Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   52 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
Phase 1 : THe cIrcle Of lO ve aND cOMP aSSION 
53
Those scientists came up with a simple practice you can do that 
actually trains your compassion levels, or your heart resonance, to use 
their term. You can do it right now. The practice looks like this:
Think about someone you love.
Imagine them standing in front of you, smiling. As you see their 
face, tell them you love them.
Feel the depth of your adoration in your heart and stay in this 
feeling for thirty seconds.
Now, let me tell you what you just did.
The mere act of using your compassion muscles caused biochem-
ical changes to immediately take place in your body. You’ve just done 
a gym session for your heart resonance that produced oxytocin along 
with other well- being- inducing chemicals. If you had a scientist with 
you right now, she’d be able to show you on a heart monitor as well 
as a brain scan what awesome effects just happened.
When I got wind of how easy this process is, I had an idea. I de -
cided that for Phase 1, we’d start with the HeartMath heart resonance 
hack, then expand that love outward to encompass the whole planet. 
It proved much easier than trying to create compassion for the whole 
human race out of thin air.
So whether it’s your spouse, kid, guru, or cat whose purr soothes 
your soul . . . the first step is to identify someone or something you 
love. No judgment on who or what you choose. As long as you love 
them, they’ll work perfectly for this exercise.
Then we will use your loved one as a trampoline.
Granted, that sounds weirder than I intended. What I mean is, 
we’ll use the good vibes their little face brings you to bounce off as a 
springboard. We’ll recycle the love you have for them into the rest of 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   53Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   53 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

the world. First to your household, then your city, then your country, 
then your continent, and finally, to the entirety of planet Earth.
Next, I’ll outline exactly what you’ll be asked to do during the Six 
Phase Meditation. Don’t worry about remembering this process by 
heart, because you can listen to me guiding you by using the Six 
Phase Meditation in the Mindvalley app.
This is just to deepen your understanding and, ultimately, your 
experience on the meditation cushion.
The Circle of Love and Compassion Protocol
Step 1— Bring a Loved One to Mind
Take a deep breath, and on your exhale see a loved one in front of you 
in the most vivid detail possible.
See them smiling with stars in their eyes. If you’re not very visual, 
just sense their presence. First, simply internalize the feeling of com-
passion by tuning into the love they inspire within you. Bring your 
awareness to your heart space, and give those feelings of love a color. 
It could be pink, light blue, green, whatever comes to mind. Allow 
yourself to marinate in oxytocin as you breathe deeply. Let them 
know how much you adore them, and cash in your one- way ticket to 
bliss from the get- go.
Step 2— Let the Compassion Encompass Y our Body
Let yourself go from feeling compassion for your loved one in your 
heart to feeling the sensation all over your body.
Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, allow this feeling of love to 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   54Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   54 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
Phase 1 : THe cIrcle Of lO ve aND cOMP aSSION 
55
travel from your heart space into every single cell of your body. Allow 
that soothing, colorful light to expand from your heart to encompass 
your entire system. Feel it form a comforting bubble around you. You 
deserve some of your own love too. T ry your best to find compassion 
for yourself. As my good friend and one of our most loved Mindval-
ley teachers, Lisa Nichols, says, “Fill your cup first . . . only then can 
you serve from your overflow.”
Step 3—  Expand Y our Compassion into the Room  
Y ou’re In
Now it’s time to expand that compassion and connection into the 
room where you’re meditating.
Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, see that bubble of 
compassion expanding. Imagine it expanding and covering every liv-
ing creature in that room, including people, plants, and pets— no 
boundaries needed. For me, it feels really good to do this while I’m 
sitting up in bed next to a sleeping partner or family member. There’s 
something really wholesome about it.
Step 4—  Send Y our Compassion into the Streets
Now that you’ve got the hang of expanding compassion through 
space, you’re ready to go a bit further afield into your neighborhood.
Imagine your bubble of compassion spreading throughout your 
entire home first, touching anyone who lives there. Next, imagine it 
expanding to engulf your entire neighborhood. I like to bring to 
mind a random neighbor who suddenly smiles out of nowhere be -

cause they can feel the positive vibes I’m sending. Keep breathing 
deeply and maintain that feeling of love as strongly as you can.
Step 5—  Allow Compassion to Encompass Y our City and 
Country
Start with your city, then expand to your entire country.
For this part, I like to see a map of my city in my mind’s eye that 
zooms out into a map of my country. You can see your city as if you’re 
flying over it in a helicopter or viewing a drone shot of it. Visualize 
your city covered in the light of your compassion.
Next, expand this compassion until it encompasses the entire 
country. See it covered in the light of your compassion. Use your 
imagination here. Feeling that love in your system, take a deep breath, 
and on the exhale, in your mind’s eye, share the love with the nation.
Step 6—  Allow Y our Compassion to Envelop the Earth
Here’s where it gets interesting. Take a deep breath. From your coun-
try, you’re going to keep sending this compassion out into your con-
tinent on the exhale.
Then, make your way through every single continent for each 
new exhale: North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, 
Oceania . . . even to the penguins in Antarctica. See your compassion 
as a friendly tsunami, washing over the entire planet. This is the final 
stage of the compassion practice that connects us not just to those 
closest to us, but to all life on Earth. Go wild. See people of all na -

tions and cultures. See birds in flight, see the big cats, see rain forests 
and snowstorms, see sunsets, and way into the depths of the ocean.
See it all and feel your place in this beautiful world.
The last image you see should be the planet Earth, beautifully 
covered in the light of your compassion.
If you get lost at any point and lose the oxytocin- laden vibes you cre-
ated in step 1, return to your loved one. See your nearest and dearest 
in front of you once more, charge yourself up with love, and spread 
it outward again.
It might take a bit of practice, so don’t beat yourself up if you’re 
struggling to share the love at first. Cut yourself some slack— you’re 
part of the less than one percent of people who are training themselves 
out of survival mode. You’re in the Compassionate Being Bootcamp.
Once you’ve got the hang of it, it’ll become second nature. And 
you’ll be one of those remarkable individuals who not only feels a 
connection with their social circle, but with all of humanity.
Imagine what that will do for your mental health. Imagine what 
that will do for every single person you come into contact with. Be -
cause trust me, they’ll feel your energy.
Can you imagine if all of us dedicated some of our time to com -
passion training? I swear, it could save the world. Think about it. 
Think about the most (manmade) traumatic events in history, the 
ones that nearly wiped us all off the face of the damn Earth. They all 
came about, to some degree, due to a lack of compassion.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   57Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   57 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

58
Think about how many wars we’d avoid. Think about how we’d 
treat the planet. Think about how we’d treat our loved ones, the 
stranger on the street, and ourselves.
Now you know that compassion is so much more than sympathy. 
Rather, it’s about creating a kinder world and finding your unique 
place within it. It’s such a powerful attribute of humankind that it 
may well be our biggest evolutionary achievement. It’s our silent su-
perpower.
I resonated with Marvel’s much- loved Viking superhero a lot 
when he said:
I would rather be a good man than a great king.
Same here, Thor.
When I’m on my deathbed, I doubt I’ll be too concerned with 
how much power I’ve had over others, or how much “success” I’ve 
had. Odds are, I’ll be reflecting on how well I mastered compassion. 
Yes, I’ll be thinking about how well I learned to love.

PHASE 2
Happiness and Gratitude
I was complaining that I had no shoes  
till I met a man who had no feet.
Confucius
What’s humanity really searching for?
Scientific progress? The meaning of life? Infinite wealth? The elixir 
of immortality?
Yes. Yes to all of the above. But there’s something even more valu-
able we can’t resist searching for over everything else. According to 
Einstein in 1931, in one of his many interviews, “It’s happiness we’re 
after.”
Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein was 
just as curious as we are about the elusive nature of joy. And just as  
he provided the world with revolutionary formulas in the field of 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   61Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   61 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

theoretical physics, he also found an equation for happiness. And it 
sold for $1.56 million.
Einstein’s $1.5 Million Happiness Formula
After traveling to Japan in 1922 for a series of scientific lectures, Ein-
stein claimed to have been deeply contemplating the question of hap-
piness during his entire trip.
With a backdrop of cherry trees and geishas, he found himself in 
the perfect place to connect with the true meaning of well- being. 
After finding the secret formula, he lovingly handwrote it in his first 
language, German, on a piece of paper.
Convinced of its great value, he handed the thirteen- word for-
mula to the hotel’s bellboy as a tip for making a delivery to his room.
It read:
Stilles bescheidenes Leben gibt mehr Glueck als erfolgreiches 
Streben, verbunden mit bestaendiger Unruhe.
In case your German is a little rusty, here’s the translation in Eng-
lish:
A calm and humble life brings more happiness than the pursuit 
of success combined with constant restlessness.
Einstein’s beautiful gesture was worth its weight in gold. Literally. 
Ninety- five years later, one of the bellboy’s family members sold that 
piece of paper for $1.56 million at an auction.

63
But what does it actually mean?
You may have your own ideas, but from my perspective, Einstein 
wasn’t just telling us to drop our goals and settle for less. I’m a big 
advocate for setting intentions and having a vision for our lives, 
which we’ll cover later on. No, I reckon he was warning us against the 
“lack mind- set,” the “not- enough” principle, the striving, and the 
blood, sweat, and tears that block true fulfillment.
I believe he wanted to set us free from the widespread “I’ll- be- 
happy- when” syndrome: the never- ending chase that brings “con -
stant restlessness.”
And what’s the one bulletproof medicine to support us in healing 
from it?
The power of gratitude.
More on the “I’ll- Be- Happy-  When” Syndrome
Before we dive deeper into the science of gratitude and how it di -
rectly influences our happiness, I want to tell you more about the 
almost unspoken syndrome I just mentioned.
I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But if you’re a human liv-
ing in the twenty- first century, you’ve probably got it.
And it’s bringing humanity to its knees.
The ultimate peace- thief, the “I’ll- be- happy- when” syndrome is 
the notion that attaining after certain worldly pleasures or accom -
plishments leads to inevitable happiness. Except they’re always just 
out of reach. In today’s “thank you— next!” world, we’re told that 
happiness waits for us on the other side of [insert pleasure/achieve -
ment.] But when we get there, of course, happiness eludes us.

We may feel short bursts of happiness when, after striving, we fi-
nally obtain these things. That said, the novelty soon wears off, and 
lo and behold, we’re back to square one.
Introducing the Happiness Gap
The world- renowned entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan talks about 
this fascinating idea that he named the “forward gap,” which refers to 
the classic human condition of dissatisfaction. We all experience this 
gap as soon as our awareness homes in on the difference between 
where we are right now and where we want to be.
The forward gap is the distance between our present satisfaction 
and the happiness we believe we will gain when we hit a future out -
come.

rower, bewitched into believing we’ll be happy when we do so. But 
here’s the thing. You were tricked. Because you’ll never, ever be able 
to close it.
It’s like running toward the horizon under the deluded impres -
sion you’ll be able to touch the sun. No matter how fast you run or 
how many laborious miles you cover, the sad truth is that the heat of 
the horizon will never touch your skin. This is the “restlessness” Ein-
stein was referring to on that famous scrap of paper.
Be honest with yourself. Do you ever feel like you’re postponing 
your happiness indefinitely? That’s the “I’ll- be- happy- when” syn -
drome at its finest. Because even if you do manage to hit your goals, 
before you know it the gap will be back. It’s a bottomless cup of desire 
we’ll never fill. But we’re addicted to trying.

that horizon like a madman for most of my life in a desperate attempt 
to close that gap. I had the “I’ll- be- happy- when” syndrome, and hell, 
it still catches me out from time to time. And no wonder.
We were raised by parents who had already been infected, because 
their parents were, because their parents were, because their parents 
were. The idea that happiness is attainable through external means is 
far from new.
Yet there’s nothing wrong with this, either. Progress happens be-
cause of our yearning, generation after generation, to make life better. 
This yearning has a positive aspect— it makes us build, invent, create, 
improve— over and over again as a human species.
But the great secret is to understand that happiness is actually the 
rocket fuel for productivity. And that we should be happy before we 
reach our goals. Dan Sullivan defines this as the “reverse gap.”
The reverse gap is what you get from looking backward.
It’s the joy we get from recognizing just how far we’ve come.
And you must embrace the reverse gap as much as the forward 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   66Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   66 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

67
gap. This is especially true if you’re the type of person who is goal- 
driven or absorbed in growing your career or business.
Dan Sullivan noticed a “forward gap pattern” in hundreds of en-
trepreneurs. They were wonderful people with wonderful lives— yet 
they were harboring feelings of unfulfillment.
They had the “I’ll- be- happy- when” syndrome.
They all believed their fulfillment was just around the corner. And 
they’d all fallen into chasing that ever- further horizon. They were try-
ing, and failing, to close the infamous happiness gap.
So Dan suggested a simple flip of that mental model. His clients 
went to work on training themselves, daily, to pay attention not just 
to where they were going, but to where they’d been. They reflected on 
the achievements they already had in the bag. They reflected over 
their triumphs, their happy memories, and the deep relationships 
they’d forged with their loved ones. They focused on what they had, 
not what they were lacking. But most of all, they reflected on how far 
they’d come as people and how they’d changed for the better.
They developed a calmer life, with less restlessness.
In other words, they began a gratitude practice Einstein would be 
proud of.
How Did We Get So Obsessed with Postponing 
Happiness?
We live in a society that that constantly reminds us how much hap -
pier we’d be if we bought whatever they’re selling. Our happiness has 
a price tag, and nobody forks out more than someone with the “I’ll- 
be- happy- when” syndrome.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   67Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   67 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

68
When we’re stuck in the forward gap, our consumerist society 
cracks open the champagne to celebrate. Yes, we’re encouraged to be 
a bit unhappy.
Why?
Because there’s not a whole lot of money to be made in happy 
people, is there?
Think about how many beauty companies would go bust if 
women woke up tomorrow feeling at peace with their bodies.
Think about how the electric appliances mega monster (that 
rhymes with Grapple) would crumble if people stopped caring about 
upgrades and started spending real FaceTime with the ones they loved?
Think about how quickly the pharmaceutical industry would go 
under if we started taking the reins of our mental health holistically. 
More on that later.
You get the picture, anyway. We live in a world that constantly 
offers ever newer, ever shinier solutions for attaining happiness 
through external means.
You grew up in this world. But you don’t have to continue living 
in it if you choose not to.
The Rebellious Nature of Gratitude
Gratitude is by far the fastest, most efficient way to produce happy 
chemicals in your body from thought alone. It’s about wanting what 
you already have, and celebrating it emotionally. It’s about being 
thankful for the blessings in your life, be they huge or minuscule.
It’s about being present where you are right now and raising a 
glass to all the good things you’ve got going on.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   68Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   68 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

69
That’s true happiness if you ask me.
And although it’s tempting to follow the crowd and chase short- 
term hits of dopamine over cultivating true happiness, I swear it’s 
worth the fight. Because gratitude- induced well- being is the kind of 
happiness that has no “if” or “when.” It’s the kind that never goes out 
of style. It’s the kind that, just like compassion, doesn’t cost a dime.
Furthermore, gratitude is an act of rebellion on many levels.
It rebels against the gap.
It rebels against the “I’ll- be- happy- when” syndrome.
It rebels against society’s depiction of what happiness should 
look like.
It rebels against consumerism.
It rebels against misery, depression, and lack.
Gratitude creates magical results in our inner and outer worlds. 
But it’s not magic.
It’s science.
The Science of Gratitude
There have been hundreds upon hundreds of scientific studies carried 
out on gratitude, and for good reason. Gratitude is the human char-
acteristic most widely associated with states of well- being. The more 
we study it, the more blown away scientists, brain experts, psycholo-
gists, and personal growth enthusiasts become. It’s really powerful 
stuff.
My favorite study would probably be the one by Dr. Robert A. 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   69Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   69 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Emmons of the University of California. In this particular study, he 
asked all his participants to write a few sentences per week in their 
journals. The topic depended on which of three groups they were in.
The first group wrote about things they were grateful for.
The second group wrote about the things that went wrong or that 
displeased them in some way.
And the third group wrote about all the events that had affected 
them in the past week with no particular emphasis on how positive 
or negative they were.
After ten weeks, the results came in. Unsurprisingly, those who 
focused on what they were grateful for felt more optimistic, fulfilled, 
and generally more positive about their lives. What was surprising, 
though, was that they also exercised more than usual and had fewer 
visits to doctors when compared to the other two groups. What’s 
more, the effects lasted long after the experiment had finished.
As I said, this is one of the hundreds of incredible studies out 
there on the subject of gratitude. I imagine that you’re not interested 
in trawling through every single one. But just know that all of them 
prove that when you create feelings of gratitude through thought 
alone, gratitude journaling, or meditation, incredibly interesting 
things start happening to your mind and body.
Here’s what else scientific studies have proved to be true about 
gratitude. The benefits include:
 1. Increased levels of energy and vitality
 2. Higher emotional intelligence
 3. Boosted mood (release of happy chemicals in the brain)
 4. Greater tendency to forgive

 5. Prevention or lessening of depression/anxiety
 6. Improved relationships and sociability
 7. Better, deeper sleep
 8. Reduced inflammation/headaches
 9. Less physical fatigue
 10. Enhanced feelings of life satisfaction
A day in the life of the future you (with a regular gratitude prac -
tice) may look something like this, then. You wake up with the joys 
of spring after a deep, restorative sleep. You’re ready to interact with 
your family and colleagues from the get- go thanks to your height -
ened emotional intelligence. You have a job that others may describe 
as stressful, but you don’t feel it nearly as much as your colleagues do. 
You’re not as fast to finger- point either. As you go through your daily 
meetings, your workmates often inquire as to why you seem so joyful 
all the time. You smile, feeling focused and vital in your body, as well 
as being totally ready for the challenges of the day. When you get 
home in the evening, you’re still riding the waves of your good mood. 
And when you head to bed, you do so with a profound sense of sat -
isfaction for another day well- lived.
If someone offered us a little pill that provided all of these bene -
fits, with no side effects, free of charge, we’d snatch their hand off, 
wouldn’t we?
So why is it that we don’t hear about gratitude, but we do hear 
about Prozac?
Well, the pharmaceutical lobby is massive. The gratitude lobby?
Not so big.
Great for the mind, great for the pocket, gratitude doesn’t require

you to spend a single dime to be happy. All the deep healing and hap-
piness is going to happen in your head. Organically. With no gluten. 
It also works just as well without a new salt lamp, yoga mat, grass- fed 
unsalted butter, prayer beads, or a Discover Your Divine Feminine 
Through Aromatherapy coursebook.
Okay, perhaps the one thing you’ll want to buy yourself is a nice 
gratitude journal to write in before you go to bed. But that’s it. You 
really do get more than you’re required to put in with this one.
The Myths Behind Gratitude
Just like compassion is saddled with lots of misconceptions, gratitude 
also has its fair share of unhelpful myths. So let’s break them down.
First off, a lot of people think that we can reap the benefits of 
gratitude only when things are going hunky- dory in our lives. And 
granted, gratitude flows a lot easier when we’re receiving gifts, eating 
gourmet food, getting paid, or painting the town red with our friends.
But if you ask me, gratitude shines the brightest in the darkest 
times. Gratitude in and of itself builds incredible levels of resilience 
and safeguards us from dropping into depressing rabbit holes. The 
ability to stop in the midst of pain and chaos and notice the value in 
it is a skill that will serve you until the day you die.
There will be times when you wake up in a foul mood due to a 
crappy night’s sleep. But you have two choices: you can condemn 
yourself and your lack of shut- eye, or you can be grateful for the fact 
that, unlike at least one billion people in the world, you have a bed 
and a roof over your head.
I’m not belittling you and your feelings here. Lack of sleep sucks. 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   72Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   72 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

But we always have a choice as to where we direct our focus. Through 
this practice, you’ll come to learn that no matter how grim things 
may seem, there’s always something to be grateful for. And that makes 
navigating life’s hardships a hell of a lot smoother.
Sure, a colleague was curt to you this morning, but can you be 
grateful for the fact that you have a well- paid job with other col -
leagues of the gentler type?
Sure, your last date ended pretty . . . badly, but can you be grateful 
that you never have to see them again and can enjoy the company of 
friends?
So, we’re not denying our shortcomings here, we’re just reframing 
them. We’re extracting the gold from the dirt.
And there’s always more gold in your life than you think.
Feeling grateful every day isn’t dependent on huge wins like cash-
ing in your lottery ticket, learning your book hit the New York Times 
bestseller list, or completing your first marathon. You can be just as 
grateful for the small things, too.
Funnily enough, it doesn’t particularly matter what you’re appre-
ciating; rather, it’s how much you’re feeling it.
Imagine being able to marinate in oxytocin and appreciation 
when you receive a hug from your kid.
Imagine experiencing pure elation when your coworker hands 
you a cup of tea as a treat.
Imagine taking your first conscious breath in the morning with a 
heart full of gratitude for the mere fact that you’re alive.
It’s not the size of the celebration that matters, it’s the motion of 
the emotion.
So when you practice gratitude, try not to just speed through the 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   73Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   73 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

mental motions like a checklist. Rather, feel into every single mem -
ory with all your senses. It’s free, it’s organic, and you deserve it.
And for those of you who have never actively participated in a 
regular gratitude practice, don’t beat yourself up. It doesn’t mean that 
you’re an inherently ungrateful person. This is a gratitude practice, 
after all, and before you know it, it’ll feel a lot more natural.
What’s more, there may be people reading this book right now 
who have lived very tough lives. They may well be thinking that, dur-
ing their lifetimes, they haven’t received all that much to be grateful 
for. And that’s fair. Oftentimes, the events in our lives come down to 
plain luck, and life can be a series of challenges and blocks.
But as I said before, one of the biggest myths about gratitude is 
that your life needs to be perfect in order for you to feel it.
If Y ou’re Going Through a T ough Time
Remember: Even the happiest people benefit from gratitude. But it’s 
the unhappy people going through hell who need gratitude more 
than anyone else.
And that might be you right now.
Sometimes it seems like life hasn’t dealt us a set of cards that are 
gratitude- worthy. You might not have been lucky enough to have it 
all plain sailing.
Some of you reading this book right now are suffering in silence 
in an abusive relationship. Others may be stuck in a job where the 
working conditions are awful, governed by a company that violates 
their human rights. Some of you may be suffering from a debilitating 
illness.

In these incredibly trying times, I acknowledge that asking you to 
feel grateful for that particular hardship is a nearly impossible, bor -
derline disrespectful, feat. So I’m not saying you should be in denial 
about your circumstances. Being grateful doesn’t mean accepting an 
abusive relationship, putting up with a toxic work environment, or 
giving up the fight against cancer.
You can still be grateful for your life in general and simultane -
ously muster the strength to make the necessary changes to get your-
self out of whichever painful situation you’re in. And if you can, I 
urge you to do so.
There is always hope, no matter how faint.
You may have found this part hard to digest, which is completely 
understandable. But what I stick by is the fact that you can always, 
always show love and appreciation for one thing.
Yourself.
And you must. You deserve it more than I can describe.
This is called self- appreciation— and it’s a fundamental part of the 
Six Phase Meditation.
When you hit rock bottom, gratitude for the most simple things 
will be your saving grace.
Gratitude is the silent, unassuming key to surviving the biggest 
traumas as well as enjoying the pleasures of life. I could write a whole 
book about gratitude, but for now, I hope this chapter convinces you 
of its power and inspires you to get practicing.

The 3x3 Gratitude Method
Now that you know all about the science and benefits behind grati -
tude, as well as having smashed through the myths, I’ll talk you 
through how we’re going to approach the practice.
In the Six Phase Meditation, I’ll be taking you through the 3x3 
Gratitude Method step by step. Again, you’ll be fully guided by the 
audio, but it’s good to gain some clarity on the process before you 
begin.
It’s called the 3x3 Gratitude Method because you focus on three 
different aspects of your life and three things you’re grateful for in 
each of these categories.
The three different aspects of your life are your personal life, your 
work life, and your fine self (aka— self- appreciation). Within each of 
those areas, you’ll come up with three examples of things you’re grate-
ful for. For example:
PERSONAL LIFE
 #1: I’m grateful that I get to wake up next to my amazing partner 
every single morning.
 #2: I’m really appreciative of the fun, wine- drenched birthday party 
my friends threw for me last night.
 #3: I’m truly grateful for the delicious cups of coffee my favorite 
café serves me each day.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   76Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   76 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
77
Phase 2 : HaPPINe SS aND GraTITuDe
WORK LIFE
 #1: I’m grateful for my job and how challenging, stimulating, and 
fun it can be.
 #2: I’m really appreciative of my colleague [insert colleague’s 
name] and how they always give me a smile when I arrive at the 
office.
 #3: I’m truly grateful for the money that flows to me from my com-
pany every single month— money that facilitates the high qual-
ity of life I live.
YOURSELF
 #1: I’m grateful that I’m the type of person who finds it easy to give 
and receive affection, and I appreciate the fact that I am so lov-
able.
 #2: I’m really appreciative of my body, and I love my shape.
 #3: I’m truly grateful for my unique talents, the languages I speak, 
and my ability to use my mind to its maximum potential.
These are just some examples, but you can go wild here, as long as 
you cover all three bases.
I designed the exercise this way because what I kept noticing 
about gratitude meditators was that they tended to express gratitude 
only for the strongest area of their life.
If they were workaholics, they’d explore their professional wins 
and forget about their personal lives. If they were die- hard family 
people, they’d tend to focus only on their kids and spouses and forget 
about their careers. All this creates an imbalance.

Another mistake a lot of people make when they express gratitude 
is that they forget to feel grateful for themselves. Through our fear of 
being labeled narcissists, we seldom reflect on what makes us incred-
ible. Because of this, we opt for getting our validation from external 
sources. We let other people fill our cups, latching onto feedback, 
compliments, and confirmation that we’re good, successful people, as 
opposed to serving ourselves. So if you ask me, the problem isn’t too 
much self- love, but rather too little.
I don’t know anyone who’s hot on praising themselves, to be 
honest.
But I do know plenty of people who would be more than happy 
to share how unskilled they are, how their contribution to the world 
just isn’t enough, or how much they detest the size of their thighs.
A Note on Body Image
This not- enoughness is most prevalent with body image. We’ve all 
got something against our poor bodies.
You may be overweight or underweight. You may be shorter or 
taller than “normal” for your gender. You may not have the enviable 
skin that television commercials say you should be proud of. You may 
have scars. You may have a visible health issue. You may have teeth 
that aren’t sparkling white or straight. The list goes on, and odds are 
you’ll deem yourself less than perfect in one of these areas.
But if you’re reading this right now, you’re a living, breathing 
human being who is here by complete, perfect fluke. You are the re-
sult of an obscenely lucky sperm who made it to one very lucky egg. 
You weren’t just one in a million. You were one in five hundred mil-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   78Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   78 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

lion. Your body, the one that you’re fortunate enough to inhabit, is a 
freakin’ miracle in and of itself.
So, please, do yourself a favor and start appreciating your body as 
it is. We need to quit this whole thing about forcing our bodies into 
a particular stereotype of beauty.
We should take care of ourselves so we’re healthy, sure, but enough 
with the shame.
What I’ve discovered is that when we train people to express grat-
itude for themselves and take a couple of minutes to reflect on every-
thing they actually like about their bodies and their characters, great 
things start happening. Number one, it feels good, and that feeling of 
wholesomeness and peace travels with them all day.
Number two, they become less insecure, more confident, and 
more resilient to haters. They go from having holes to feeling whole.
Number three, their relationship with themselves gets much more 
solid.
Number four, their relationships with others get healthier because 
they’re not as needy and reliant upon others’ constant validation.
Not bad for a few seconds a day of self- appreciation, right?
Gratitude and Manifestation
If all these reasons to practice weren’t enough— you know, the self- 
confidence, the happiness, the fewer visits to the doctors, the fulfill -
ment, the saving grace from any pit of despair . . . 
 . . . There’s actually more.
Gratitude has been strongly linked to achievement, success, and 
abundance.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   79Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   79 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Why? Because it’s just like the much- loved motivational speaker 
“Zig” Ziglar once said:
The more you are grateful for what you have, the more you will 
have to be grateful for.
Some of the wealthiest people in the world have used gratitude as 
a practice to draw more money to them. And it works. In The Science 
of Getting Rich, author Wallace Wattles wrote:
The grateful mind is constantly fixed upon the best. Therefore, it 
tends to become the best; it takes the form or character of the best 
and will receive the best.
This isn’t just fluff; it’s logic. And if you land a regular gratitude 
practice, even if your bank balance doesn’t change for a while, it’ll feel 
like it has. Abundance is a mind- set, after all. And as we’ve seen, the 
abundant mind, just like a magnet, will draw more abundance to it. 
Like attracts like.
T ry your best to perfect this gratitude practice; it may well be the 
single missing ingredient that’s been keeping you from true joy, peace, 
and prosperity.
The Happiness and Gratitude Protocol
Step 1— Y our Personal Life
First, you’ll think about three things, events, or people from your 
personal life that you’re grateful for.
It doesn’t matter if you reflect on something from yesterday or 
from twenty years ago. It doesn’t matter if a loved one is alive or de-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   80Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   80 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

81
ceased. It doesn’t matter if it’s a huge thing or a little thing. Feel free 
to mix and match topics and timelines— as long as you can feel the 
appreciation, it really doesn’t matter.
You could reflect on the deep sleep you had last night that you 
really needed.
Perhaps you could appreciate your home and how it humbly shel-
ters you from the cold and the rain.
You could bring to mind the delicious, nutritious food you have 
in your fridge— a privilege that billions will never experience.
You could remember the day you first clocked eyes on your 
spouse, relive the butterflies, and thank goodness you met them.
Maybe you could appreciate that backpacking trip you took with 
friends when you were in your twenties, or any other precious mem-
ories that light you up when you think of them.
As I mentioned before, try not to just make a list. Because it’s not 
about the list itself, but about the feelings associated with each mem-
ory, person, or thing. So feel the good vibes, feel the love, and em -
body the appreciation. This is the easy part. Step 2 can be a little 
more challenging for most.
Step 2— Y our Work Life
Next, you’ll shift your focus to what you’re grateful for in your career 
and working life.
This was a very deliberate inclusion because many of us underes -
timate this area of our lives and the countless blessings that it brings 
us. But if we’re spending five days of the week working, it makes 
sense that we ought to make work- based gratitude a habit.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   81Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   81 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

82
Even if you thoroughly despise where you’re at right now, there 
will be something you can be grateful for. I’m not saying you should 
stay there if you’ve been considering jumping out of the office block’s 
window. If you’re that unhappy, you probably should leave. But in 
the meantime, bring to mind three things about your work life that 
you value.
If nothing else, you could reflect on how grateful you are for that 
cash that appears in your account every single month, and how it 
supports you and your family.
You could bring to mind a special colleague you work with and 
feel thankful for the kindness they have shown you.
You might be thankful for the sky- high demands of your job, and 
how they’ve facilitated your learning and growth.
You could even reminisce over that crazy Christmas party you had 
a few years back when the receptionist got drunk and dove into way 
too much detail about her nonexistent sex life . . . and feel happy you 
got to witness the hilarious awkwardness of it all.
Just watch that space. Before you know it, you’ll have shifted your 
perspective on your job for the better, and feel so much more positive 
for it.
Step 3— Y ourself
Okay, so for the newbies to personal growth and inner inquiry, this 
will probably feel difficult at first.
Like I said earlier, step 3 is all about honoring and respecting 
something that we’ve never been taught to honor or respect . . . our-
selves.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   82Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   82 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

83
And when you start loving yourself through a self- gratitude prac-
tice, you can then head out into the world as the best, most confident 
version of yourself.
So just like in steps 1 and 2, you’re going to pick three focal 
points.
Maybe you start by appreciating your openness to give this a go 
in the first place, which in and of itself sets you apart from a lot of 
people.
Perhaps you feel grateful that you’re a kind person, with a good 
heart.
You could pick out a physical aspect of yourself you appreciate 
having, like the color of your eyes, your strong legs that have carried 
you around the world, or your authentic smile that makes other peo-
ple smile too.
You could reflect on your intellectual feats, such as how much you 
appreciate your mind for constantly expanding, learning new lan -
guages or skills, and coming up with fresh ideas.
Maybe you could thank yourself for your motivation, for how 
you never miss a yoga session, for how you (almost) always hit your 
deadlines and strive to eat healthily every day.
You could thank yourself for being a great father, or reflect on 
how far you’ve come as a businesswoman.
Go for it. This last step is the most difficult but by far the most 
important. When all else fails, and the cards you get dealt in your 
personal and professional life bring you to your knees, you can always 
fall back on self- appreciation.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   83Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   83 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

So, here we are, reversing the effects of the “I’ll- be- happy- when” syn-
drome.
We’re reversing that forward gap.
We’re taking the reins of our mental health without the need for 
a pricey prescription.
The time you spend in a state of gratitude is never, ever wasted. 
And as we’ve seen, there’s always something to be grateful for. It goes 
without saying that we live in an imperfect world, and there will al -
ways be changes we wish to see in our lives and the lives of others. 
The “I’ll- be- happy- when” syndrome will always be a tempting path 
to follow, but we aren’t going to tread it.
Because now we know that the only antidote to our unending 
cycles of desire, yearning, emptiness, and striving is gratitude. Stock-
ing up on it is the smartest thing we can do if we want to live a truly 
happy life. Period.
The famous Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus summed it up best 
a couple of thousand years ago. And his words are as true today as 
they were then.
He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he 
has not, but rejoices for those which he has.

itude. The lesson is just a few minutes long and will recap some of the 
most important points in this chapter.
Upon completion, you can then dive straight into the meditation 
audio where I’ll guide you through the gratitude protocol. It will take 
less than five minutes but will help lock in the second phase of your 
practice. As we progress we will layer on each phase. So in this audio 
we will start with Phase 1: The Circle of Love and Compassion, and 
then stack on Phase 2: Gratitude. This stacking causes each phase to 
build upon the one before, thus enhancing the potency of the medi-
tation.

Peace Through Forgiveness
As I walked out the door towards the gate that  
would lead to my freedom, I knew that if I didn’t leave  
my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.
Nelson Mandela
Allow me to introduce you to the three Rs: resentment, rejection, and 
regret.
As a human being living on planet Earth, you’ll experience all 
three at some point or another.
These babies, above all other feelings, are the most insidious. 
They’re the ones that linger and eat away at your state of mind for 
days, weeks, months, and even years.
The reason? They’re all based on events that happened in the past.

And just like the world’s favorite shamanic monkey says in Disney’s 
The Lion King:
Oh, yes, the past can hurt!
As Rafiki whacks Simba on the head relentlessly with his crooked 
staff, Simba comes to realize that just because something hurtful hap-
pened in the past, that doesn’t mean the pain has gone anywhere. 
And unless we learn something from it and let go, the three Rs will 
continue to stay. The whacks and wallops of life will continue to rain 
down on our heads, feeling harder and harder to bear.
That’s where forgiveness comes in.
Forgiveness: The Ultimate Antidote for the 
Pains of Y our Past
A widely accepted definition of forgiveness goes as follows:
Forgiveness is the decision to let go of the desire for revenge and 
ill will toward the person who wronged you.
I agree, but I think it’s more than that. I think that forgiveness is 
less about the other person and more about setting yourself free from 
negativity. I believe that forgiveness is the underrated antidote to the 
poison that comes from the three Rs. Because you can’t change the 
past, but you can reframe the way you think about it.
It’s through forgiveness that the burn of anger, upset, and hostil-
ity can cool off, making room for happiness again.

It’s through forgiveness that our hearts and relationships can 
heal.
It’s through forgiveness that we can walk forward into a brighter 
future, free from the chains of he/she/them- who- must- not- be- named. 
More on that later.
Furthermore, science is now discovering some pretty mind- 
blowing news about how forgiveness affects your physical body.
The Weird, Incredible Benefits of Forgiving
A co- study by various universities in America, Asia, and Europe 
found out that “people induced to feel forgiveness perceive hills to be 
less steep and jump higher in ostensible fitness tests than people who 
are induced to feel unforgiveness.”
These findings proved that forgiveness can literally lighten the 
physical burden of unforgiveness, facilitating better health, perfor -
mance, and stamina.
The benefits of forgiveness don’t just stop at feeling a bit lighter 
emotionally . . . forgiveness can literally make your body weight feel 
lighter while hiking up a mountain or shooting hoops.
Good news for sherpas and NBA players, then.
No joke, after I was lecturing on this forgiveness study one time, 
I actually had an Olympian basketball player contact me. He wanted 
to know how to go deeper with forgiveness meditations so he could 
go for gold on his jumps.
Here’s another unexpected, odd benefit. For those of you with 
cardiovascular issues, listen up. Forgiveness has also been proven to 
support a healthy heart rate as well as improve blood pressure. Isn’t 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   89Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   89 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

that beautiful? The physical and the metaphorical hearts are healed by 
forgiveness— two birds with one stone.
Additionally, when you’ve worked on forgiveness, you’re way less 
likely to have compromised mental health and take that bad juju out 
on those around you. So when you make the decision to forgive, the 
ripple effects of hurt end with you.
That’s pretty heroic, right?
Who’d have thought that all these advantages could be birthed 
from short, meditation- based forgiveness exercises?
All this revolutionary forgiveness stuff is relatively new to me, by 
the way. Forgiving whoever wronged me was never my forte. Not by 
a long shot. I actually came across the benefits of forgiving our ene -
mies by a lucky accident.
And this is where the story gets a little more metaphysical.
An Experiment to Biohack a Monk’s Brain 
Activity onto Our Own
It all started when I got myself strapped up in a dark room in British 
Columbia, twelve electrodes stuck to my head, hoping I could zen 
out under pressure.
It was 2016, and I was in one of the strangest establishments I’d 
ever been in. I was about to experience the physical, mental, and 
more importantly, spiritual benefits of forgiveness firsthand.
But I can assure you I wasn’t expecting any of it.
I’d decided to enroll in a five- day brain- training experience called 
40 Years of Zen. It was a joint event by the Biocybernaut Institute 
and famed biohacker Dave Asprey. I did so with the hopes of rewir -
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   90Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   90 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

ing my mind through meditation in order to “tap into my unlocked 
potential.” I wasn’t 100 percent clear on what that meant, which is 
partially the reason I turned up. I’m a sucker for a mystery.
It set me back fifteen thousand dollars to make it onto the waiting 
list. Fifteen thousand dollars was no joke. It goes without saying that 
the classes and experiments I participated in were filled with high- 
flying, very successful, very wealthy individuals, all hoping to over -
dose on bliss. Little did we know that it was forgiveness that would 
get us there.
Long before my arrival, the scientists at the institute had been 
hard at work studying the brain- wave states of Zen monks who’d 
spent twenty to forty years deep in meditative practices.
As they analyzed the results, they noticed something very differ -
ent about the monks’ brains compared to the average Joe’s brain. 
Specifically, two things. First, their alpha levels (the waves your brain 
emits when you’re relaxed) had seriously high wave amplitudes. Sec-
ond, the brain waves had what is known as “left- right brain coher -
ence” (an impressive brain wave symmetry between the logical, 
analytical side and the creative, intuitive side). And all this was true 
not just while they were meditating but also in their normal, every -
day waking state.
The entire team was excited about these findings and explained to 
us how alpha- wave- inducing meditation can change your brain for 
the better, help you get into flow, bump up your IQ, and even in -
crease your creativity.
But more exciting still, they informed the new batch of science 
guinea pigs, the batch I was part of, that they were looking into 
whether it was possible to transfer zen- like states of mind to normal 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   91Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   91 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

people. They were seeking to create permanent shifts in one’s brain 
patterns to resemble the brains of monks who had been consistently 
meditating for twenty to forty years.
Here’s where my ears well and truly pricked up.
I soon came to realize that this stuff isn’t hokey, it’s real. Thanks to 
my inherent skepticism, my tolerance for fluff was and continues to 
be pretty low. Show me the science and it’s a done deal. And at that 
institute, you got nothing but experiments, analysis, and results.
Each day for five days, after the five hours of meditation in a 
chamber with our brains hooked up to machines, we would sit with 
our dedicated neuroscientist and analyze our brain wave states and 
changes.
I had been under the impression that I knew all there was to 
know about the key elements of meditation, and how to use them for 
maximum results.
But I was wrong.
Although my brain waves reflected a pretty zenned- out state of 
mind, my results were nothing when compared to Sally’s.
It was Sally who planted the seeds of curiosity about forgiveness. 
It was Sally who inspired Phase 3.
Sally, without a shadow of a doubt, had one of the biggest brain- 
wave transformations the institute had ever seen. Her story was the 
stuff of legend. Sally had come to the institute desperate and stressed 
out. But over the five days, her brain waves showed remarkable im -
provements that gobsmacked the scientists there.
But what exactly was she doing to get such amazing results?
At this point, the institute was still in its early years and the re -
searchers weren’t yet completely sure about which meditative mo -
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   92Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   92 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

dalities would lead to these blissed- out states. It was the calmest 
free- for- all ever. They’d simply set people up in biofeedback chambers 
and tell them to go crazy. Relax, deep breathe, think happy thoughts, 
visualize the ocean, figure it out.
So that’s what Sally did. But her progress was second to none.
When the institute inquired about what technique she was using, 
she asked, “You really want to know?”
They really did. The board of scientists nodded in sync and wit -
nessed her take a deep breath in before exclaiming shamelessly:
I was forgiving the hell out of my asshole husband.
Sally went on to explain that she had dedicated herself to actively 
forgiving her ex- husband throughout her brain training sessions. T o 
this day we still have no idea what her ex- husband did to her. But 
whatever steam she was letting out of her system as she meditated in 
the lab was working wonders for her brain.
Forgiveness as an alpha- wave- inducing megatool? Interesting. 
T urns out, after studying thousands upon thousands of people from 
all walks of life, the scientists at the institute claim that there’s one 
surefire way to attain these desirable brain states. And that’s through 
a forgiveness practice. Forgiveness was the key to getting one’s brain-
waves to most closely resemble those of Zen- Roshi monks who had 
spent decades meditating.
But here’s where the concept got kind of spooky.
On day four of the event, I’d sat down for breakfast at an inn 
nearby where I was lodging with fellow participants. Suddenly we 
saw Matt running down the stairs, looking at his phone.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   93Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   93 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Now Matt (name change) had joined us at the institute because 
he’d been going through a tough time. Exactly why, before that morn-
ing, he’d not chosen to share. Visibly perturbed, he looked like he’d 
just seen a ghost.
“Matt, what’s the matter?” I asked.
Matt replied, “My . . . my brother just messaged me.”
“Was it bad news, did something go wrong?”
“No . . . It’s just that I haven’t spoken to my brother in two years.”
Matt went on to explain that something inexplicable had just 
happened. You see, Matt had spent the last three days at the institute 
forgiving his brother. And what his brother had done to him when he 
was a child had really messed him up.
In his twenties, Matt had become severely addicted to cocaine 
and sex with prostitutes to deal with the pain. His unhealthy relation-
ship with intimacy was ruining his life, as he felt unable to create 
meaningful relationships. But it wasn’t the cliché fame- got- to- him 
story. He wasn’t living the rock- and- roll, live- fast- die- young lifestyle 
out of jovial vigor.
He’d found himself on the road to ruin because his brother had 
abused him sexually when he was a child.
Needless to say, Matt loathed his brother.
At the institute, upon learning about the power of forgiveness for 
personal healing, he’d spent time attempting to forgive his brother. 
And that’s when, on day four, something quite unusual happened. 
Matt’s brother, out of the blue, had sent him a video on his phone 
telling Matt how sorry he was, asking for forgiveness himself.
Matt’s brother had absolutely no idea that he was at this institute.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   94Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   94 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Phase 3 : Peace THrOuGH fOrGIveNe SS
His story shocked all of us.
This showed that forgiveness seemed to cross some nonphysical 
boundaries and impact the lives of the people we are seeking to for -
give. Furthermore, forgiveness had a way of healing both the victim 
and the perpetrator.
Forgiveness: Ripple Effects in the  
Nonphysical Field
Years later, I came across an idea that explains phenomena like this in 
an interview I did with Gary Zukav, an American self- empowerment 
teacher and author. He spoke about how utterly and deeply con -
nected we are to one another in the nonphysical world— much more 
than we’ve been taught to believe.
Here’s what Gary told us:
The nonphysical law allows you to use nonphysical causes to 
create nonphysical effects and also physical effects. This does not 
mean that you are not in control of what you create. On the 
contrary! It means that you are entirely free to create what you 
want, provided you are aware of how the nonphysical law of 
cause and effect works.
So Gary would say that what happened with Matt was no coinci-
dence. Matt created that outcome with his brother in the nonphysi -
cal field via forgiveness.
Gary went on to explain that nonphysical reality is actually more 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   95Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   95 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

96
our home than the physical reality we’re seeing around us right now. 
If you think about it, we came from nonphysical reality before we 
were born, and we’ll return to it when we die. But while we live on 
Earth, a huge part of us still resides and evolves within that non -
physical realm. Therefore, the majority of our interactions with other 
human beings may actually be occurring in that same nonphysical 
reality. Gary put it this way:
Your intentions are your nonphysical causes that set energy into 
motion. They create a multitude of effects and, therefore, 
determine the experiences of your life.
It’s become apparent that, even if the other person doesn’t know 
you’re forgiving them for something, the act, in and of itself, can cre-
ate ripples none of us currently understand. Apart from feeling good 
in our own system, then, could forgiveness directly affect and influ -
ence the behavior of those around you? The simple answer is yes.
So I decided to try it myself.
My Strange Stroke of Luck After Experiencing 
Deep Forgiveness
After doing some of my own research on a few of the other benefits, 
I felt drawn to give this forgiveness thing a try myself. And funnily 
enough, the day I decided to forgive my biggest pain point, I man -
aged to hit my highest levels of alpha- wave amplitude to date.
I remember opening my eyes after the meditation was over, tears 
streaming down my cheeks, before being greeted by the highest num-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   96Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   96 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

ber I’ve ever scored on the biofeedback screen. It was a sight for sore 
eyes (literally).
But the good stuff didn’t stop there. In the summer of 2017, I 
returned to my forgiveness training at 40 Years of Zen, this time in 
Seattle. There it was confirmed that forgiveness not only increases 
your peace of mind and alpha levels but also creates magical results in 
your outer world.
The scientists there explained to me that one of the side effects of 
going deep into this process was that synchronicity and manifesting 
accelerate. In short, your innermost desires and dreams come true 
faster and more easily. But being scientists, they didn’t use the words 
synchronicity or manifesting. Instead, what they said is that people 
seemed to get “luckier.”
What a beautiful promise.
Now, like 99 percent of children in my generation, I had been 
told by older and wiser humans that if something sounds too good to 
be true it probably is. So I went in there with my doubts. What hap-
pened next was a bit of really outlandish, unexpected, mind- blowing 
luck.
After I’d finished all my forgiveness training that summer, I re -
turned home and went about my life. I returned to the “real” world— 
you know, work, kids, bills, normal stuff. I’d forgotten about what 
the scientists said about the whole forgiveness- induced- happily- ever- 
after thing.
The year before I’d just published my first book The Code of the 
Extraordinary Mind. T o be honest, I was a little anxious about how it 
was going. When you write a book, you automatically put yourself in 
a very vulnerable spot. The urge to search for reviews and rankings is 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   97Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   97 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

98
overwhelmingly strong, but you don’t. You don’t, because you’d be-
come obsessed. It’s a slippery slope. So it’s a rule. Once you publish a 
book, your only job is to let go of the results and hope for the best.
By that point, I knew it had become moderately successful, but 
even so, you never, ever snoop around your Amazon page or glance at 
your book sales or rankings. You tell yourself you’re done and you 
move on to your next book.
A few weeks after my training I had a weird impulse. “Check your 
book on Amazon,” said my intuition one afternoon as I was working 
at my computer. (Side note— when you practice forgiveness, you be-
come more intuitive.)
What? No. I wouldn’t. You DO NOT check the Amazon page.
“Check your book on Amazon.”
But . . . 
“Check your book on Amazon.”
That voice was pretty persistent that I should break the rules this 
time.
I caved.
What the hell? I checked again. It can’t be. I checked again.
Amazon was showing me as the second best- selling author in the 
world, ahead of T olkien and J. K. Rowling. And weirder still, the day 
before, on September 16, 2017, my book had become the number 
one book in the world on Amazon Kindle.
Now that, for me as a writer, was music to my disbelieving ears.
Was this a coincidence? Maybe. Or was it the “luck” those scien-
tists spoke about?
Forgiveness, it turns out, is a transcendental training in and of 
itself that can lead to extraordinary events in our lives. It’s an incred-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   98Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   98 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

ibly powerful manifestation tool as well as a path to health and pros-
perity.
Do we fully understand it? No. But as physicist Nassim Hara -
mein once said, “Spirituality is nothing more than physics that we 
have yet to find an equation for.”
But . . . Can We Forgive Anything and Anyone?
I know what you’re thinking. All this is well and good, but what if 
someone did something really, really bad?
What if the act is unforgivable?
First of all, at the end of the day, you’re doing it for you, not for 
them. Not forgiving is cheating yourself because you, of course, are 
worthy of all these benefits and deserve to live a life without resent -
ment.
The first rule of forgiveness is that we absolutely can forgive any-
thing.
Just think about my friend Matt the next time you think some -
thing is unforgivable. If Matt can forgive his brother for sexually 
abusing him when he was a child, you can forgive whoever hurt you. 
If Nelson Mandela can invite his jailers (who locked him up unjustly 
for twenty- seven years) over for dinner to break bread, you can for -
give whoever it is that messed up your life.
Forgiveness liberates you, but as we’ve seen, it can also open doors 
to amazing opportunities and provide you with the traits you need to 
live your best life.

How Forgiveness Frees Y ou: Ken Honda’s Story
There’s this incredible man by the name of Ken Honda. He’s also 
known as “the happy panda” and happens to be Japan’s pride and joy. 
And for good reason.
The “Zen Millionaire” (another name he goes by) is truly one of 
the most successful, nicest, and most fulfilled people I’ve ever met. 
And guess what? He attributes his success, in large part, to the prac -
tice of forgiveness.
In his Mindvalley Money EQ course, he shared something quite 
personal with us.
When Ken was a little boy, he was scared to be around his father. 
As an extremely regimented, struggling Japanese businessman, his 
father had been hardened by life’s challenges and tended to take it out 
on his son. But Ken’s father never told him what problems he was 
carrying, and he never, ever strayed from the stoic path. Like most 
Japanese men at the time, his father would never show his emotions.
That is, until one evening when Ken wandered into the kitchen to 
find his father sobbing.
Face reddened and huge tears streaming into the manly hands 
that attempted to shield his face, Ken witnessed something he’d never 
seen before.
He didn’t know it was possible for a man to cry.
“My father . . . crying?”
Needless to say, Ken was taken aback. What could have caused his 
big, authoritative, rock of a father to cry like a baby?
The one thing that made the world go round. Money.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   100Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   100 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
101
Phase 3 : Peace THrOuGH fOrGIveNe SS
That was the beginning of a downward spiral. They were strug -
gling financially, and at that tender age, Ken became very aware of 
their money issues.
Money must be bad.
Money is stressful.
There’s never enough money.
Money makes my dad cry.
These, among others, were the beliefs Ken absorbed about the 
concept of money. They’re classic.
Our limiting beliefs are given to us by our parents, and they 
quickly turn into huge blocks that solidify over time. Money blocks 
are probably the most common of all, but unfortunately, they often 
have the biggest consequences. One of the consequences? Money 
stops flowing to you because you don’t believe it will. It caused Ken a 
lot of difficulties as he grew up, and it was all his dad’s fault.
Not only had his father abandoned him emotionally and shown 
him little to no love growing up, but he’d also bestowed huge money 
blocks on him. Thanks a lot, Dad.
That said, there’s a happy ending to the story. Judging by Ken’s 
profile today, it goes without saying that he found a way to rise above 
it all. How? Ken describes what happened:
The most important thing for me to do was to forgive my father. 
After a few tries, I finally forgave him. And in this forgiveness, 
we found such a deep connection. I even heard him say the 
words, “I’m sorry for everything.” I wasn’t expecting that.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   101Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   101 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

102
Ken forgave him for giving him such a hard time when he was a 
child, and it turned out that Ken’s father had been treated the exact 
same way by his own father.
He was hurt a long time before me in the same way by his 
father. So now we have a new connection. Empathy. T oday we 
have made such a deep bonding as brothers.
Hurt people hurt people, after all, and that understanding helped 
Ken bond with his father and accelerate the forgiveness. But that 
wasn’t all. Not only did Ken heal his money wounds, but the new -
found empathy he had for his father opened the door to his huge 
success story. Here’s what Ken told me:
I used to have a lot of issues listening to people who were older 
than me because I didn’t trust them like I didn’t trust my father. 
But after healing all this hurt with my father, I was able to 
become closer to older people. That’s why I became such a good 
student with many of my money mentors, including the great 
Wahei T akeda.
It was Wahei Takeda, the Warren Buffett of Japan, who mentored 
Ken into becoming Japan’s number one writer of fifty- plus books. 
One in twenty Japanese people have read Ken. No other writer even 
comes close. And it’s thanks to his own forgiveness journey that he’s 
been able to help millions of people heal their money wounds for a 
better life too.

“I Have Sent Y ou Nothing But Angels”
Any Neale Donald Walsch fans out there will know that he too is a 
huge advocate for forgiveness. He’s mostly known for his Conversa-
tions with God book series (which have sold over fifteen million cop-
ies). But as amazing as those books are, it’s one of his lesser- known 
works that has a really special place in my heart. It’s a children’s book 
about forgiveness.
By the way, if, like me, you have young kids and are interested in 
teaching them how to forgive and healthily navigate all the emotions 
that come with it, you definitely want to grab a copy. It’s called The 
Little Soul and the Sun. In that book, Neale shares a very interesting 
message: in short, that God, the Great Spirit, the universe, sends you 
whatever you need (not what you want) at the right time.
If someone betrays you, although you may deem them to be the 
devil in disguise, they’re actually there to teach you valuable lessons 
and provide you with an opportunity for self- discovery. As God says 
to the Little Soul in the book, “I have sent you nothing but angels.”
That’s not to say you have to be best buddies with the perpetrator. 
That’s a common misconception about forgiveness, and it tends to 
put people off. Forgiveness is not about getting back with your ex or 
dropping the charge if someone has committed a criminal offense 
against you. It’s not a pardon, and it doesn’t justify the horrible, hei-
nous acts that you may have suffered through. No way. Leave that to 
the legal system.
In short, you can forgive the thief. But you still report him to the 
law so he doesn’t go on to rob someone else.

Even if you didn’t press charges, at the very least you can rest in 
the knowledge that karma’s a bitch.
Joking.
(Not.)
But on a serious note, hear me when I say that forgiveness is never 
about the other person. Forgiveness is a personal, internal process of 
healing. It’s all about you and your well- being, not about anyone 
else’s.
You’re doing this for yourself, not for them.
Through this process of letting go, you’re wisely liberating your -
self from the poisonous three Rs (resentment, rejection, and regret, 
remember?) and deciding to leave the rest up to the universe.
What’s more, Neale advocates the idea that, once you’re literate in 
forgiveness, you’ll get to a place where you’ll actually have fewer and 
fewer things to forgive in the first place.
“The master never needs to forgive,” he told me, “for the master 
understands.”
Neale explained to me that at a certain point, after truly, deeply 
going into forgiveness, the act eventually becomes automatic. At that 
point, you simply understand the perspectives of others (however 
flawed) and are no longer triggered by their bad decisions or actions.
This is the key to the next idea: becoming unf*ckwithable.
Forgiveness: A Fast Track to Unf*Ckwithability
That’s another thing forgiveness gives you. The ability to be calm and 
powerful in the face of attack.

Years of Zen event. The participants in the class had gotten so close 
we had all decided to stay in touch with each other online.
As I was being driven to the airport I saw that Matt had posted a 
message in our group chat.
It was a meme that read like this:
UNF*CKWITHABLE
DEFINITION— (adj.) When you’re truly at peace and in 
touch with yourself, and nothing anyone says or does 
bothers you, and no negativity or drama can touch you.
Matt wrote below the image. “I think all this forgiveness just 
made us all unf*ckwithable!”
I smiled. And I fully agreed.
Unf*ckwithable people don’t just happen. Badass people are 
grown from turbulent life experiences, grit, blood, sweat, tears, and 
hard- core forgiveness of the highest caliber.
So that’s what forgiveness gives you as a parting gift, along with 
milestone life lessons. But when I refer to forgiveness, I’m not just 
referring to the perpetrators who graced your life with their bullsh*t. 
There’s self- forgiveness to tackle too. That’s another ball game.
Do Y ou Need to Forgive Y ourself?
Self- forgiveness is even more hard- core.
Many of us carry secret regrets and self- loathing around with us 
like rocks in our pockets without even knowing it. But as time goes by, 
that missing forgiveness will have a huge impact on your self- esteem.

Listen. If you’ve done wrong, learned your lesson, and are commit-
ted to not doing it again, you deserve your own forgiveness. Period.
You can let it go. We all screw up, and that doesn’t make us bad 
people. Our mistakes don’t have to define us. Our ugly acts don’t 
make us inherently ugly. Just remember: The best apology to anyone 
else and yourself is changed behavior.
As you read the forgiveness protocol, know that it is there to help 
you forgive yourself, too.
Once you get good at it, you can remove those tiny pocket rocks 
or huge boulders of resentment out of your metaphorical backpack. 
Whether it’s shaking off the shade your waiter threw at you at last 
night’s dinner, forgiving yourself for a huge betrayal, or cleansing 
yourself of the pinpricks of grudges against those you love, the ben -
efits of forgiving are endless.
Again, you’re not pardoning anyone or doing this for anyone 
other than yourself. Remember this.
Without further ado, here’s the forgiveness protocol I designed 
for the Six Phase. It’s inspired by Dr. James Hardt from the Biocyber-
naut Institute, and it has also been refined by Dave Asprey’s team at 
40 Years of Zen.
So be kind to yourself, go slow, and allow your forgiveness skills 
to deepen over time.

107
The Forgiveness Protocol
Step 1— Identify the Person or Act to Forgive
Choose the person or act that you’d like to forgive.
If you’re doing this for the first time, start with something small. 
Forgiveness is like a muscle; you need to strengthen it before delving 
into the heavy stuff. I’d pick a person I genuinely loved, like my part-
ner or my kid, and forgive them for an everyday annoyance of some 
kind. From there, with practice, you can build it up to the more major, 
traumatic events that have haunted you for years. But not just yet.
Remember, you can also choose to forgive a younger version of 
yourself for something you did in the past. This can be just as trans -
formative, if not more so, than forgiving someone else.
Step 2— Create the Space
Pick a comforting, relaxing environment in your mind to allow the 
forgiveness process to happen.
You can choose a real place, like your garden or living room, or 
you can imagine a place— say, on a tropical Costa Rican beach. It 
could even be your version of heaven or a holy place of worship. 
Bring that person to mind and see them standing in front of you in 
this environment. Know that you’re protected and nothing bad can 
happen on this mental, theatrical stage. This is all happening in the 
safety of your mind.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   107Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   107 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

108
Step 3— Read the Charge
Imagine inviting the person, or representation of the act, into your 
safe space. You’re about to read out the charge as though you were a 
judge in court.
For example, you could recite the misdeeds like this: “[insert 
name], you brought me pain and suffering by [insert misdeed.]”
Keep it formal, professional, and detached, but try your best to 
cover the details, too. Read it like you’re a professional attorney speak-
ing in court. Say it all, including why you think the misdeed was so 
wrong. Leave nothing out.
Here is an example of a charge I mentally read out when I was 
forgiving a former school principal for punishing me cruelly when I 
was a kid.
I had forgotten my shorts for PE class that day. And you wanted 
to exploit your power, so you picked on me. I was fourteen years 
old. I was a kid. My only mistake was forgetting to pack my 
shorts. Yet you made me stand in the hot sun on the basketball 
court for three hours. My class teacher asked you to stop. I was a 
good student and had great grades. I sweated in the sun till I 
almost fainted. I lost my respect for you. I lost my respect for my 
school. The punishment must fit the crime. You cannot punish a 
young kid like that.

Phase 3 : Peace THrOuGH fOrGIveNe SS
109
Step 4— Feel the Anger and Pain
After stating the charge, take a moment to fully feel the anger, resent-
ment, and sadness this person may have caused you.
Allow yourself to express it, too— shout, scream, cry, curse, what-
ever you need to do to bring all these feelings to a climax. (Don’t 
worry, this will only aggravate your pain temporarily. Think about it 
like a clenched fist— you have to clench it fully to then completely 
release and relax it.) You can set a timer for two minutes if that feels 
safer. Afterward, take a deep breath in and choose to let it all go.
The goal here is to not bury your feelings. It’s to let them out and 
then heal them.
Step 5— Identify the Lessons Y ou Learned
Rumi said, “The wound is the place where the light enters”— 
meaning, there is value to be claimed from every seemingly negative 
experience. So what did you learn from this scenario?
For example, “From this painful experience, I learned to set 
healthy boundaries and break my addiction to people- pleasing,” or “I 
learned that I’m so much stronger and more resilient than I gave my-
self credit for.”
When we identify the lessons in our hardships that made us bet -
ter people, we give meaning to our suffering. That step reframes it 
and gives it worth, laying the foundation for us to move forward, 
cleansed of resentment. My friend Michael Beckwith refers to this as 
a “kensho” moment, translating as “growth through pain.”
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   109Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   109 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

110
Step 6—  Think of How the Other Person May Have Been 
Hurt in the Past
Hurt people hurt people. So how did this person suffer in the past? 
What happened to facilitate their bad behavior toward you?
For example, in my case, “[insert name] hurt me in this way be -
cause of his own lack of self- esteem, which he’s had since childhood, 
when he suffered bullying at school. It was self- sabotage.”
Let your ideas flow freely. People are very rarely inherently evil, 
and considering their story will help you put the pieces together and 
form a logical understanding.
If this part doesn’t come easy, it might help to transform the per-
son in your mind’s eye to their younger self. See them standing there 
as a child. What could have screwed them up so badly that they felt 
that this behavior was okay?
When I thought about the school principal who punished me so 
cruelly as a kid, I remembered that he was a former weight lifter. 
Perhaps he had a coach who pushed him too far. Perhaps he felt that 
he was making me stronger by pushing me in turn. When I saw him 
as a younger man, perhaps with an abusive coach, I began to under -
stand where his strictness came from.
Step 7—  See the Scene Through Their Eyes
For this step, you’ll need to imagine you have mind- reading super-
powers. Imagine you’re floating out of your body straight into theirs. 
See the scenario through their eyes.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   110Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   110 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
111
Phase 3 : Peace THrOuGH fOrGIveNe SS
What might their thought process have been to explain why they 
did what they did to you? How did they feel as they were doing it? 
Did they even consider that their actions might cause you pain? How 
did they see you at the time?
Again, it helps greatly to imagine them as a child. What did they 
witness or experience that might have caused them to act in this way 
as a flawed adult?
You don’t have to justify it or agree with it by any stretch of the 
imagination, just experience it for yourself as best you can. This is 
where empathy comes in and separation fizzles out. We’re all humans, 
we’re all connected, and we’re all flawed in some way.
Step 8— Forgive into Love
I know this step may seem corny, but it’s very deliberate. When I 
asked the scientists at the Biocybernaut Institute how we’d know if 
we’d truly forgiven someone, they said: “It’s hard to tell, but the best 
measure of it would be a hug. If you saw that person in your mind in 
front of you while you’re meditating and felt at ease with the idea of 
hugging them, you’ve most likely forgiven them into love.”
So ask yourself if you can visualize forgiving this person in your 
safe space with love to the point of hugging them. If you’re strug -
gling, it can help to visualize them as a child again, a lost innocent 
child who didn’t know any better. So hug them, safe in the knowl -
edge that you’re absolutely protected. By this stage, you should be 
feeling a lot lighter.
Now, you’ve healed yourself, not them. You’ve removed a poten-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   111Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   111 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

tially huge, karmic scar from your system. If we were to measure your 
brain waves now, we’d see a dramatic increase in your alpha waves 
and left- right brain coherence.
If you have something really painful to heal, you might have the same 
person in your daily Phase 3 for the next few weeks. But you can rest 
assured that you will forgive them in time. You get out what you put 
in. And if your intention is pure, if your true desire is to forgive, 
you’ll achieve it. T rust me.
I’m not saying this process is easy. It’s not meant to be.
And I’ll put it out there here and now that this is by far the most 
challenging of all the phases of the Six Phase Meditation. It takes a lot 
of strength to do this, and most people never even bother trying. But 
now you know why it’s worth your while to be the bigger person who 
does. Now you know that it’s forgiveness that liberates you from the 
pain that holds you back from the best version of yourself.
As Rumi once said, “Oh ye who can’t take a good rub. How will 
you ever become a polished gem?”
So, allow yourself to get buffed by the roughness of life, with all 
the flawed and fallible humans who surround you on the journey.
Because then, and only then, can you go out there and shine for 
all the world to see.

Before you proceed to the next chapter, open up your Mindvalley app 
and launch the Six Phase Meditation program. From there, you can 
jump into the full interactive lesson for Phase 3: Peace Through For-
giveness. The lesson is just a few minutes long and will recap some of 
the most important points in this chapter. Upon completion, you can 
then dive straight into the meditation audio where I’ll guide you 
through the forgiveness protocol. It will take less than five minutes 
but will help lock in the third phase of your practice.
Bonus: In the Six Phase Meditation course that comes with this 
book, I’ve also included a bonus video where I teach an intuition- 
based technique to help you gauge if and when you’re done forgiving 
someone. That way, you’ll know when to move on to the next item 
on your forgiveness list.

A Vision for Your Future
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
Gandalf, Lord of the Rings
I had a dream.
Sure, it wasn’t Martin Luther King– level, but it was a pretty gran-
diose goal to me.
I, Vishen Lakhiani, wanted to represent my country, Malaysia, in 
a world- class international Taekwondo tournament.
It was 1993, and I was seventeen years old. At the time I was re -
ally into martial arts, worshiping my ultimate deities: Bruce Lee and 
Jean- Claude Van Damme (who at that time had just starred in the 
movie Kickboxer). I was the type of kid who could barely maintain a 
conversation at school— and since I’d been picked on most of my life, 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   115Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   115 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

my father, like any good dad, had decided to enroll me in Taekwondo 
(also known as Korean karate) so I could kick butt.
Since it bestowed a newfound sense of self- confidence on me, Tae-
kwondo quickly became my obsession. I would practice in the garden 
every single day, kicking our papaya tree barefoot, just like Jean-  
Claude Van Damme would in his iconic role in Kickboxer. I, of course, 
never managed to topple that papaya tree, and I usually gave up at the 
first sign of stabbing pain, but my enthusiasm was undeniable.
But this one afternoon my martial arts instructor told me the 
most exciting news of my life thus far: that there was going to be a 
major Taekwondo competition at the US Open 1993 in Colorado 
later that year, and that I had a shot at representing our flag.
First, I’d have to beat all of my classmates in a wood- breaking 
competition. Then, after getting selected, I’d compete against all 
other top players in my country at the nationals. If I landed gold in 
both, I had a chance of being selected to play in the US Open.
I’d never set foot in the United States before and it would be an 
understatement to say that it was my ultimate dream to go. The USA 
was a mecca for me. I’d often catch myself daydreaming about what 
it would be like: the land of Hollywood movie stars, MTV , Coca- 
Cola, hamburgers . . . 
T o add to the allure, my instructor told us he’d throw in a trip to 
Disneyland for the finalists.
So that settled it. I had to win this competition. And it soon be -
came the biggest obsession of my seventeen- year- old brain.
While my peers focused their attention on girls and video games, 
I went about furthering my studies on the philosophies of creative 
visualization. Back then, I was an avid manifestation geek.

117
My obsession with meditation and creative visualization had 
started when I discovered a book called The Silva Mind Control 
Method on my father’s bookshelf. The author, José Silva— who I men-
tioned earlier— had developed a powerful method to train your brain 
to enter relaxed states before visualizing the outcomes you wanted.
The Silva Method was one of America’s earliest and most popular 
personal growth programs and it was as big in the 1980s as T ony 
Robbins or Mindvalley is today.
Arming myself with my basic knowledge of the Silva Method, I 
went about practicing. I became quite the teen connoisseur of cre -
ative visualization. Around ten months before the competition, I’d sit 
down three times a day, every day, to see my dream unfold. I saw it 
all. I saw myself landing in the United States and breathing in Amer-
ican air, which I assumed was filled with awesomeness and can- do. I 
saw myself heading to the training center in my badass Taekwondo 
uniform. I saw those flashing lights bathing me in attention, applause 
surrounding me, as I marched into the ring to face my opponent, 
“MALAYSIA” sewn with love on the back of my perfectly ironed 
Taekwondo uniform.
The day finally came. It was time to literally smash stage one: the 
wood- breaking competition. At this stage, you’d find yourself facing 
three human beings with black belts holding three planks of wood. 
The rules were simple: break all three pieces of two- inch- thick planks 
they were holding with one kick, in the fastest time possible.
I’d be up against my fellow classmates, my friends. But they were 
no friends of mine today. T oday, I’d have no mercy. Disneyland was 
at stake.
I heard the whistle blow.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   117Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   117 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

I took a deep breath. I knew I had a few seconds to break every 
single piece, and I was as ready as I ever would be. I lifted my foot 
gracefully in what felt like slow motion and let out my best imitation 
of a high- pitch Kung Fu– style heia!
BOOM.
BOOM.
BOOM.
Done. I put down my foot like a ninja, and the wood was still 
there intact. But that didn’t faze me one bit. I was confident it would 
break. It would be like one of those epic scenes from a Samurai movie 
where the warrior would slice his enemy in two, only to see the pieces 
slide apart seconds later in slow motion.
Once they did, the pieces would fall to the ground, and I’d mari-
nate joyfully in rapturous applause.
T en seconds later, the wood was still solid.
The whistle blew again.
I was out.
I’d failed to break a single fiber of those planks. Staring at my 
right foot like it was a dead rat on the end of my shaking leg, I dragged 
my sorry ass out of the training hall.
I was out, and I’d not even passed stage one.
Ashamed, I was seriously considering not even attending the na -
tionals to support my team members who did break their planks.
And worse— my faith in creative visualization was gone. It had 
failed me in my most desired goal. But this wasn’t the end of the 
story. I was about to discover the first lesson of creative visualization.

119
Lesson 1: Be Unattached to the “How”—  
Instead Focus on the “What” and the “Why”
I’d presumed that what would get me to my goal of winning the 
championship was the “how”— me breaking that wood in the first 
trial, which would lead to the next, and so on. But I’d failed.
Little did I know that I was about to learn that as long as you 
focus on the “what” (getting to the US Open) and the “why” (because 
it was my passion), the “how” will take care of itself. And the “how” 
turned out to be a stroke of luck nobody could have called.
After spending the saddest week of my seventeen- year- old life so 
far sulking, I finally got to the point where I accepted my fate. And 
the time had come to be a good teammate. I ended up sitting alone 
in the stadium to watch the best players in Malaysia fight it out for 
that spot at the US Open. And thank God I did.
There I was, sitting with my hood up on the sidelines, supporting 
Daniel, one of my teammates at the time. He’d just fought an incred-
ible match, surely landing him a spot in the US Open. He was a 
similar height and build to me, and he’d made it. But to my surprise, 
he came limping toward me at the end of the match.
“Vishen, I think I injured my foot.”
Wow, really?
“My next competition is the wood- breaking round. But I feel like 
I might have a hairline fracture. If I break the wood I’ll screw up my 
foot even more than it already is.”
I nodded in silence.
“Would you take my spot?”
Wait, what?
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   119Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   119 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

“It’s just for the wood breaking, Vishen. Do you have your Tae -
kwondo uniform?”
Funnily enough, I did. I’d shoved it in my backpack that morn -
ing, as I always did. I’d watched way too many Superman cartoons 
and figured that I too could save lives or catch a bad guy in my crisp, 
white Taekwondo robe one day. I’d always had this fantasy of walking 
down the street, only to witness a poor old lady get her purse stolen 
by a robber. Upon witnessing this atrocity I’d dive into a nearby 
phone booth, do a lightning- fast change, and pop out again fully 
dressed for the occasion, ready to kick the robber’s ass and save grand-
ma’s purse. T rue story.
So anyway, I’d come prepared.
Before I knew it, I was there dressed in full gear representing my 
class in the Malaysian Taekwondo championship, even though I was 
never meant to be at that competition in the first place. And once 
again, I was facing three planks of wood.
In my mind’s eye, they mocked me. “Hahahahaha!” they laughed 
with their annoying wooden faces. “You think you can break us, do 
you?”
But I was audaciously optimistic. The universe had somehow de-
livered me a second chance.
The whistle blew. Deep breath, high- pitched heia!
KICK.
KICK.
KICK.
This time, I heard the applause.
I turned to look at my handiwork.
Plank one: broken.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   120Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   120 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

121
Plank two: broken.
Plank three: intact.
A second later, I heard a slow creak. Plank three: broken!
I smashed the fastest breaking time in the entire event at 52 sec -
onds. And much to my delight, alongside Daniel, I won the gold 
medal.
We were both headed to the US Open 1993 Taekwondo Cham-
pionship.
According to the creative visualization advocates, the practice can 
often bring about synchronicities and unexpected “coincidences” 
that allow your desires to manifest despite the odds. So even though 
I failed the first time, I got exactly what I’d visualized in the end. I 
broke the wood, and I was going to the US Open. I just didn’t get the 
victory I wanted in the exact way I expected. The “how” took care of 
itself in the end.
A whole new path to my “what”— getting to the US Open— had 
opened for me.
So I had a eureka moment: there was no need to obsess over how 
I’d smash my goals.
I showed up at the US open, ready for the moment of truth.
And here I would learn the second lesson of creative visualization.
Lesson 2: Be Really Clear on What Y ou Want
At the US Open in Colorado Springs, it was now time for me to actu-
ally go up against another human as opposed to a defenseless plank 
of wood in a sparring competition. This was it. My dream was com-
ing true!

I approached the ring confidently. But when I clocked eyes on my 
opponent, my heart dropped into my training shoes.
I was up against Glenn Rybak— the Dutch national champion.
Fan- f*cking- tastic, I thought to myself sarcastically.
If you know anything about Dutch people, you know that these 
are some of the tallest people in the world. And if you know anything 
about Taekwondo, you know that more than anything, it’s a kicking 
artform. So when you have the legs of a sexy giraffe, you have an in-
herent advantage.
So there I was, face to face, or should I say, face to chest, with 
Glenn Rybak. And just as I was about to give him my best shot, 
adrenaline coursing through my veins, I heard the whistle blow.
“Kid, you can’t go in there with glasses!” the ref shouted as he ush -
ered me out of the ring.
I forgot to mention that back then, I wore specs. And trust me, I 
didn’t wear them for style. I needed them. I was myopic with a minus 
seven hundred prescription. If he took them from me, I was screwed.
“I understand ref, but these are sports glasses . . . these ones don’t 
break . . .” I begged.
“No, kid. That might be okay in Malaysia, but not in this coun -
try. In America, everybody sues everybody for everything. Those 
things break and blind you, you could sue us for millions of dollars. 
We can’t take that risk.”
My face was blank.
I was a dead guy walking.
But I did as I was told.
I stepped into the ring once more, semiblind, and I heard the 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   122Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   122 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

whistle blow. I puffed up my chest and Giraffe Man’s silhouette began 
to move in front of me. At least, I thought he was in front of me: he 
could have been to my left, or my right, or hovering in midair for all 
I knew. I couldn’t see a thing. Just a few seconds in, as I was trying my 
best to figure out where the hell his limbs were . . . BANG. I fell to 
the floor.
Part human, part giant, this guy’s leg reach (and strength) was 
tremendous.
I managed to stagger to my feet. I wasn’t done yet and if I could 
just see— BANG.
Before I could even finish my courageous thought, I became the 
official Fastest Knockout in the 1993 US Open Taekwondo Champi-
onship. Thirty- six seconds.
I was carried out on a stretcher.
When I woke up in the hospital, I had some time to reflect on 
what the hell happened.
What went wrong?
If, by the laws of attraction and creative visualization “what you 
see is what you get,” why did this happen?
That’s simple. It happened that way because that’s what I set my-
self up for.
I got exactly what I’d visualized.
When I was at home preparing for my time in the States, I saw 
myself breaking the wood. I saw myself putting on my robe with the 
word Malaysia sewn on the back. I saw myself step into the ring with 
confidence. I saw those bright lights on me. I got all that.
I only wish I’d seen myself actually walk out of the US Open, as 
opposed to being carried out on a stretcher!
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   123Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   123 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

So this was the second lesson of creative visualization. Be very, 
very specific in what you visualize.
Don’t learn this lesson the hard way, like I did. You must see your 
accomplished goal through to the very end, declaring “May this or 
something even better manifest.”
Because yes, I’d seen myself enter the ring, but I’d never given a 
second thought to how I’d perform in it, how I’d feel in it, or how I’d 
leave it.
I was so taken aback by the idea of actually making it to the US 
Open, that I hadn’t bothered to contemplate what I actually wanted 
out of the experience.
Be Careful What Y ou Wish For: Research Suggests 
Y ou’ll Get It
Has anybody ever told you to be careful what you wish for? Or perhaps 
they’ve warned you against being pessimistic because you’ll create a 
“self- fulfilling prophecy”?
Well, there’s actually some truth in that. Because this stuff works 
both ways. If you continuously think about something and convince 
yourself it’s going to happen, for better or worse, it usually ends up 
happening.
And there’s research to prove it.
What science is beginning to see is that creative visualization is 
one of the best- kept secrets of all time when it comes to shaping the 
world around you.
Athletes have been using this for decades, before it was cool. They 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   124Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   124 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Phase 4 : a vISION f Or YOur fuTure
knew that what the brain visualizes, the body responds to. In a study 
conducted on basketball players, Dr. Biasiotto of the University of 
Chicago proved the power of creative visualization. He tested two 
groups of players— one group who trained by actually shooting phys-
ical hoops and another who merely visualized the same training. He 
found that the percentage of improvement between both groups var-
ied by just 1 percent!
Yep, players who solely visualized themselves training were pretty 
much as effective at scoring as the players who practiced in real life.
Visualizing yourself performing, in more ways than one, is almost 
as much of a bulletproof preparation as doing the real thing. Weird, 
right?
It gets weirder. A study known as the finger abduction experiment 
showed that if you take two groups of people, one of them exercising 
their fingers in a grabbing motion, and the other simply visualizing 
the same motion, both groups get the same increase in muscular 
strength.
Think about that for a second.
Seeing yourself exercising from the comfort of your couch has a 
very similar effect on your muscles as actually hitting the gym.
Mind blown, right?
That’s creative visualization for you.
You can also heal yourself via the mind too. Heard of imagery 
therapy? José Silva, the guy who wrote The Silva Method (the same 
book that inspired me to use creative visualization to get to the US 
Open), tested this theory and proved that this process accelerates the 
body’s natural healing mechanisms.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   125Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   125 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Dr. O. Carl Simonton, a world- renowned specialist in radiology 
and oncology, stated that “the Silva system, I would say, is the most 
powerful single tool that I have to offer patients.”
This was the same incredible doctor who taught the imagery tech-
nique to 159 patients with “incurable” cancer. They’d been given 
twelve months to live. But after using creative visualization, out of all 
the participants:
• 63 were alive and well
• 14 showed no signs of cancer
• 12 had cancer regression/reductions in tumors
• 17 were stable
And the average expected survival rate had doubled to 24.4 
months. Furthermore, all of these gobsmacking results manifested 
just four months after the experiment had begun.
Luckily, I haven’t been faced with the task of healing my own 
cancer. But what I did do was heal my skin with creative visualiza -
tion.
When I was a teenager, I had a major problem with my skin. I 
had more pimples than I could count, and it was seriously affecting 
my confidence. For five years various dermatologists had tried to help 
with all kinds of weird solutions, but none prevailed.
So I set about using creative visualization, the process I learned in 
José Silva’s book, to heal it. And I did. In five weeks.
Five years of suffering had ended in five weeks due to the mere 
thoughts of clear skin. It goes without saying that that settled it. I was

a self- proclaimed miracle and would forever be a die- hard Silva 
Method fan.
I actually have my own Silva Method course on Mindvalley; it’s 
called the Silva Ultramind System. It’s the newest version of the pro-
tocol, based on José’s final discoveries before he passed in 1999. José’s 
family asked me to be the face of this updated program so as to spread 
it to as many people as possible. The Silva Method is now officially 
part of Mindvalley and one of our most popular programs.
Apart from the miraculous and pretty immediate results it can 
cause in your own life (you’ll have to see those for yourself), creative 
visualization has also been proven to:
 1. Activate your creative subconscious, which will begin to gener-
ate new plans to help you hit your goals.
 2. Reprogram your brain to be sharper and more sensitive to any 
signs or resources that will allow you to achieve your dreams 
faster (more on that in the next chapter; it’s called your reticu-
lar activating system).
 3. Build up your internal motivation levels so you can take active 
steps toward the future you desire.
 4. Strengthen your brain’s neuroplasticity (aka your ability to cre-
ate neural pathways) around the achievement of your dream 
goals.
So, ready to give it a go?

The Three-  Y ear Rule: Building Y our Personal Vision
In the Envisioning Your Future section of the Six Phase Meditation, 
you’ll be homing in on what you want to manifest in three years’ 
time. That’s three years. This time frame is very deliberate, because as 
humans we often overestimate what we can achieve in a year, and 
seriously underestimate what we can achieve in three years.
But a hell of a lot can happen in three years.
You could have completed a full mathematics degree at the world’s 
best university.
You could have met the man or woman of your dreams and tied 
the knot.
You could even have packed in your job and founded your own 
company in three years. People do it all the time.
Have you ever heard the phrase “once in a blue moon”? People use 
it to refer to something that happens rarely. That’s because blue 
moons happen only once every three years!
Three, you could say, is a magic number.
Anyway, bottom line is, three years may not seem too far ahead, 
but miraculous things can happen within that time frame.
So Phase 4 is all about visualizing your life within that time frame. 
This is your kid- in- a- candy- store moment, so take your pick.
Do you desire a body that’s healthy, fit, and strong?
Do you want a passionate love relationship?
Do you want kids?
Maybe you’d prefer to focus on the success of your business or 
career.
Alternatively, you might want to visualize some incredible experi-
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   128Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   128 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

ences, like traveling the world, forging new connections, and finding 
inner peace. Go wild, because the choice is yours.
There are no rules here, except this one. You must, must, must 
choose something that you want.
Please note the italicized you.
We’re not setting ourselves up to accomplish someone else’s 
dreams, nor are we merely regurgitating what our parents and teach-
ers told us we should want. The classic, successful linear lifestyle isn’t 
everyone’s dream.
Oftentimes what we think we want and what we actually want are 
two very different things. That’s more often than not due to these 
overbearing societal influences.
So how do we know which desires are birthed from our souls and 
which ones are pure conditioning?
When you’re trying to figure out if something is right for you, be 
it a new job or a new partner, take out a pen and paper and write 
down what you really want to see in your life. Be specific, be clear. 
Write down what you want for every category in your life.
The best method to do this is by writing a life manifesto.
So before you dive into visualizing some glorious aspect of your 
life three years out, set aside some time to do the exercise below.
The Life Manifesto T echnique by Jon and Missy 
Butcher
Jon and Missy Butcher are two incredible entrepreneurs and all- 
around beautiful people. It was this power couple who created the 
globally celebrated Lifebook approach for goal setting.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   129Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   129 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION MeTHOD
I’m a big Lifebook fan and after doing the program in 2010, I 
decided to bring Lifebook to Mindvalley. Jon, Missy, and I are now 
business partners, and Lifebook is the primary goal- setting method 
used across the Mindvalley platform. The manifesto technique you’re 
seeing here is part of this detailed Lifebook approach. I’ve simplified 
and shared it here to help you get really clear on your personal vision.
When you create your Lifebook, you uncover all your dreams that 
directly link to every single aspect of the human experience, with 
absolutely nothing left to chance. Lifebook itself is an eighteen- hour 
program that results in your creating a hundred- plus- page book with 
a vision and plan for your most glorious life. We won’t have time to 
cover the whole curriculum here, but I’ll share the basics of the “man-
ifesto technique” from Lifebook to help you perfect Phase 4.
According to Jon and Missy, an incredible way to identify and 
manifest your life vision is by putting pen to paper and writing out 
what a day in your dream life would be like in an official manifesto.
That’s it. Just one day.
But first, in order to make your vision as authentic and true to 
you as possible, you have to get clear on what you want from the 
twelve Lifebook categories:
Health and fitness
Intellectual life
Emotional life
Character
Spiritual life
Love relationship
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   130Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   130 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
131
Phase 4 : a vISION f Or YOur fuTure
Parenting
Social life
Financial
Career
Quality of life
Life vision
(That last category is basically the accumulation of the preceding 
eleven categories; it’s what your life would look like if you had all the 
other categories exactly as you’d want them to be— aka your mani -
festo.)
It’s worth noting that the Lifebook process is incredibly thorough, 
and when done correctly, you’ll be spending several hours on each 
category over six weeks. You’ll deep- dive into what’s most important 
to you and why. You’ll make plans and take inspired action to make 
it all happen. But by the end of the activities, you’ll know exactly 
what goals you’re aiming for in every single aspect of your human 
existence.
So, again, if you’re serious about this, the very best thing you can 
do for yourself is the Lifebook online program. You can find it on 
www.mindvalley.com/lifebook.
Once you’re crystal clear on all twelve of your Lifebook categories, 
you’re ready to begin writing your Life Vision Manifesto based on 
your ideal day. But you’ll do it in the present tense— as if you’re living 
your dream life right now.
For inspiration, Jon gave me permission to share his own mani -
festo with you in this book.

JON’S LIFE VISION MANIFESTO
CREATION DATE: JANUARY 2017
DUE DATE: JANUARY 2022
Missy and I have achieved simplicity on the far side of 
complexity and created our own version of heaven, right here 
on earth.
We live a life of luxury, adventure, and passion. We have 
the freedom to do what we want, when we want, where we 
want, with whom we want. We have an extraordinary life that 
works at a high level in every important area. And the hours 
of our days are OURS.
FREEDOM is our core value. We wake up every day in our 
beautiful home in Hawaii and ask ourselves, “What do we 
want this day to be about? The biggest project we’ve ever 
worked on? Nothing? Painting? T raveling?”
Life is a PLAYGROUND— a canvas for us to paint. We live 
in our unique ability. Our work consists entirely of creative 
projects that we are uniquely qualified to do. We don’t spend 
time doing anything we don’t truly want to do. This means we 
CREATE: write, record, design, produce, and BUILD.

Phase 4 : a vISION f Or YOur fuTure
We have a higher quality of life than ever before, which is 
really saying a lot! And yet, it costs almost NO MONEY to 
maintain (that being said, we have LOTS of money)! Our life-
style is autonomous, self- sustaining, and self- sufficient. We 
have a beautiful food forest, a natural meat locker, and an 
ocean that provides most of our food. We’re off the grid, out 
of the matrix, and completely nondependent on the govern -
ment.
I work on business two mornings a week— and the rest of 
my time is my own to spend with Missy and the kids, studying, 
exercising, working on creative projects, planning the next 
day’s activities, or whatever the fuck else I want to do. We 
spend plenty of time in nature . . . and we’ll make our environ-
ment in Hawaii more and more beautiful over the years. Our 
“temple- home” will be my life’s masterpiece, so that project is 
how I’ll spend most of my time in 2022 and beyond.
In 2022, there’s a relaxed and effortless flow to our days. 
They are rewarding and full. We take a walk together every 
evening. We watch every sunset together every night. In the 
evenings, we are FILLED from the day rather than drained by 
it. We bring positive, loving energy to the dinner table. We talk 
about meaningful things.
We laugh A LOT. We are relaxed, healthy, happy, and ful-
filled.
Our Hawaii nights are simply MAGICAL. Missy and I have 
deep intimacy and an absolutely amazing sex life (indescrib -
able, actually). It’s healing, exciting, adventurous, and SO 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   133Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   133 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

MUCH FUN. We’re in extraordinary physical shape for our 
age— or ANY age, for that matter! We are twin flames and 
soul mates in every way.
In 2022, we’ll spend a lot of time helping our kids define 
their goals and achieve their dreams. Our kids and grandkids 
are healthy, happy, and SO ALIVE. They are BRIGHT 
LIGHTS— nothing has dampened them, because we dropped 
out of the rat- race/matrix just before the dampening process 
began.
Missy and I have a rich social life in Hawaii. We don’t spend 
time with ANYONE we don’t love, admire, and respect. We 
hang out with fantastic people who enrich our lives and en -
hance our fun. Our best friends are always happy to travel to 
paradise to see us. We invest a lot in our friends. We travel 
with and enjoy them.
We’re doing our “soul- work, ” helping others in all that we 
do, and earning a profit proportionate to the value we create. 
We help singles, couples, and families live better lives and 
achieve their dreams.
ALL our companies are AUTOMATED and doing better 
than we ever imagined. Lifebook is the world’s premier per -
sonal development company— transforming lives on a mas -
sive scale. Purity is one of America’s fastest- growing 
businesses— transforming a $100 billion industry. Precious 
Moments provides joy, comfort, and hope to millions around 
the world. Black Star is helping people heal from addiction. 
Our entire family is crushing Lifebook for Families. And JonA-

sophically. It’s the most amazing portfolio of companies that 
a couple could ever own— and we couldn’t be more proud of 
what we’ve created!
Missy and I have a very high net worth and no debt. De -
spite our wealth, our financial life is simple, understandable, 
organized, and optimized. No complicated schemes, no fussy 
investments. We’ve cut expenses to create the biggest gap 
EVER between our income and fixed expenses, so we are FI-
NANCIALL Y FREE! Cash is more abundant than ever, we are 
surrounded by wealth— and we are living really, really WELL.
We live in PARADISE. T ruly. We have created our own 
personal vision of heaven on earth. We are fully centered. We 
are happy. We are creative. We are fulfilled. We are ultra- 
healthy. We are energized. We have an extraordinary love life. 
We have our ideal career. We have financial abundance. We 
have an extraordinary relationship with every one of our kids. 
We enjoy truly amazing friendships. We RELAX a lot and 
enjoy our life, without feeling at all guilty about the immense 
amount of leisure time we have . . . 
And that makes perfect sense, because our LIFE is our 
work.
Jon told me that he wrote that beautiful manifesto five years ago. And 
guess what?
Jon and Missy are living every single word of that life right now.
If that’s not inspiring, I don’t know what is.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   135Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   135 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

Now when you attempt to write a manifesto like this, it is quite 
likely that you’ll end up focusing on what you’re currently putting 
your energy into and ignoring what might be even more important. 
That’s because what you need isn’t on your radar yet.
For example, you might see yourself bossing your career, but ne-
glect to see yourself healthy.
You might see yourself with a six- figure bank balance, but forget 
to see yourself in a happy relationship.
On the other hand, you might see yourself falling madly in love, 
but forget to dedicate some brainpower to your finances.
You want to aim for it all. And to help you spot any gaps in your 
vision, Jon and I created a simple twenty- minute assessment you can 
take right now. After answering all the questions, it’ll produce a re -
port to let you know where you’re acing life (and what you’re neglect-
ing) in the twelve categories we shared earlier.
You can take the assessment anytime at life.mindvalley.com. It’s 
free.
Thus, in summary, to get clear on your life vision for Phase 4:
 1. Take the assessment at life.mindvalley.com.
 2. Take some time and write your life manifesto.
 3. Use what you’ve written in your manifesto to guide your daily 
visualization in Phase 4.
Here’s how Phase 4 will play out in the Six Phase Meditation.

The Envisioning Y our Future Protocol
Step 1— Choose Your Goals for the Future
I’m going to assume that by now you have written out the goals that 
you want to achieve in your manifesto (or at least thought about 
them).
These goals might include:
• T raveling the world
• Finding the love of your life
• Buying your dream house
• Becoming fluent in a foreign language
• Building your own business
• Achieving financial independence
• Having children/adopting
• Skydiving/hiking/racing for charity
• Healing from illness
• Becoming a teacher, coach, or mentor
You want to choose the goals you wish to achieve three years from 
now, remember? Be audacious and unapologetic about what you 
want, just like Jon and Missy.
Step 2— Pull Up Y our Mental Screen
As you begin to meditate on Phase 4, you’ll imagine that there’s a 
giant TV screen in your mind’s eye, and you’re watching everything 
play out like a movie.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   137Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   137 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

138
You’ll imagine that the screen is six feet in front of you, fifteen 
degrees above the line of the horizon. This is what José Silva’s research 
found provided the best results.
I know that’s pretty specific, but there’s a good reason we use this 
technique. You see, it’s been proven that if you’re actively looking 
beyond your eyelids with your pupils pointing slightly upward, your 
brain begins to produce alpha waves. And altered states of conscious-
ness are exactly what we want to access to max out the effects of cre-
ative visualization.
So switch off your electrical devices. Eyes forward and up, every-
one. The movie is about to begin. (And it’s going to be the best damn 
movie you’ve ever seen.)
You’re going to see those palm trees blowing in the breeze as well 
as those droplets of water on the outside of your piña colada glass on 
the beaches of Hawaii.
You’re going to see that delectably cute puppy you’ve always 
wanted licking your nose like you were watching a cuter version of 
Marley and Me.
You get the picture (literally). Whatever it is you’re choosing to 
see, even though it’s a goal for three years ahead, you’re going to feel 
all the emotions that you would experience as if this movie were real 
and happening right now. That brings us to step 3.
Step 3— Feel It All with Y our Five Senses
The more senses you use, the better.
Now it’s time to lose yourself in creative visualization. See, hear, 
taste, smell, and feel your dreams play out to perfection.

When you use all your senses in creative visualization, it creates 
a feeling. It creates emotions of joy, gratitude, excitement, peace, 
comfort, and enthusiasm. And according to José Silva, if you capture 
the emotions, you’re onto a winner. When you experience the emo -
tions that you’ll be feeling once these dreams come true, you’re 
priming both your brain and the universe to give you exactly what 
you want.
For extra manifestation points, don’t forget to explore how hitting 
your goals would positively impact others, too.
This is daydreaming at its best (and most enjoyable). So breathe 
deep and revel in the pleasure of experiencing your goals manifesting 
in advance.
Now it’s your turn to kick ass with the powerful effects of creative 
visualization.
I can honestly credit creative visualizations for all my major suc -
cesses in life. It led me to exactly where I’m at today. I visualized my 
move to the United States to follow my dreams. My company, Mind-
valley, hitting $100 million in revenue was visualized too. I visualized 
my two beautiful children, whom I adore, in my mind before they 
were born. This stuff works.
So go wild . . . 
Don’t underestimate what you’re capable of achieving.
Screw realism.
Most people are realists, and that’s understandable. Realist sounds 
like real, and everyone wants to “be real.” It’s the cool thing to be, and 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   139Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   139 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

I’ve got no doubt that realists think that’s the smartest way to go 
about their lives.
But it’s a giant, self- sabotaging trap, because in being “realistic,” 
people assess their realities as they are now and base their futures on 
it. It’s the “it’s happened before so it will happen again” mentality, 
which is extremely limiting.
There was a time not so long ago when women didn’t have the 
right to vote. Do you believe for a second that the suffragettes would 
have gotten anywhere if not for their unrealisticness?
For progress of any kind to happen, what we need are visionaries, 
not realists.
So I’d encourage you to dream as big as you dare. It’s like Richard 
Branson once said:
“If your dreams don’t scare you, they are too small.”

PHASE 5
 Mastering Your Day
Carpe diem quam minimum credula postero.
Horace
T ranslated from Latin as the undeniably overused phrase “seize the 
day,” the short and snappy carpe diem exclamation has some pretty 
intriguing origins.
History claims that it was Quintus Horatius Flaccus (what a 
name, right?) who uttered this phrase way back in 23 BCE. He’s 
known in the English- speaking world as the oversimplified “Horace,” 
which I find really funny.
But this whole idea of living for today and making an effort to 
squeeze as much juice out of life as possible is a lot older than Horace. 
The sentiment has run through the lines of ancient Greek literature, 
poetry, philosophical lectures, and prayers for millennia.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   141Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   141 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

142
And whether you studied history or not, you have undoubtedly 
been told in one way or another by your loved ones, teachers, em -
ployers, and preachers to treat this day as if it were your last. In one 
way or another, you’ve been instructed to do exactly what Horace 
taught his compatriots thousands of years ago while sporting his 
fetching Roman toga and sandals.
Y our Future, T oday
So why do so many of us neglect and deny the magic that is today?
Dragging themselves out of bed in the morning with no appro -
priate action plan whatsoever, a lot of people don’t realize that today 
is the future. And the importance of setting an intention for it is just 
as important as setting your goals for the long term.
It’s just as vital to plan for today as it is to dream of your life in 
three years’ time, as we did in Phase 4: A Vision for Your Future. It’s 
thanks to the actions you take today that your dreams will manifest.
Just like you did in Phase 4, you’re going to pull up that giant TV 
screen and see your awesome future play out in front of you. Only 
this time, it’s not the future that awaits in three years’ time. It’s all 
about the next twenty- four hours.
Another difference from the previous phase: you’ll split your day 
into sections that are meaningful to you. So you’ll see the upcoming 
twenty- four hours as having several segments, like a juicy futuristic 
orange.

Phase 5 :  MaSTerING YOur DaY
143
The Power of “Segment Intending”
Philosopher Esther Hicks best explains the concept known as “seg -
ment intending,” and Phase 5 is based on this protocol.
If you’re not familiar with Esther’s work, just know that she’s no 
ordinary woman. Her ability to channel Source, aka “Abraham,” has 
allowed her to download deep, divine insights many of us don’t have 
the pleasure (yet) of accessing. It was, in fact, her work that inspired 
the 2006 documentary The Secret, which went on to sell five hundred 
thousand copies, making it the best- selling DVD in history.
One of the divine insights Esther famously channeled was the 
idea that you can, and should, pre- envision and visualize your upcom-
ing day as a series of “segments” that are meaningful to you.
Here’s how a typical day might flow in segments:
07:00– 08:30: Waking up, meditating, preparing breakfast, and 
getting ready for work
08:30– 09:00: Commuting to work
09:00– 13:00: Morning meetings/work
13:00– 14:00: Lunch break with colleagues
14:00– 17:00: Work
17:00– 17:30: Commute home
17:30– 19:00: Prepare and eat dinner
19:00– 21:00: Kick back and watch Netflix with partner
21:00– 22:00: Enjoy incredible sex with said partner
22:00– 07:00: Sleep
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   143Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   143 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION MeTHOD
144
And you might top off your segments by declaring a positive af -
firmation after you run through each of them with all your senses:
“My morning will be filled with energy and joy. ”
“My workday will be highly productive, sociable, and fun. ”
“My lunch will be delicious, with a beautiful backdrop of music 
and laughter. ”
“My commute home will be pleasant and free from traffic. ”
“I will find something amazing and moving to watch on Netflix. ”
“Sex with my partner will be passionate and oxytocin-  filled. ”
I’m sure you get the picture.
Although our segments will vary (maybe you’re not working, but 
rather studying, traveling, or taking some time out right now), no 
matter what, the segment intending exercise remains the same; you’re 
going to see each and every segment unfolding beautifully.
From Esther’s standpoint, winging it through our days isn’t an 
optimal way to live out twenty- four hours of pure possibility. Rather, 
we want to become “well- disciplined people.”
In her words, “Well- disciplined people decide how they want 
their day to unfold.”
And the most optimal way to communicate (to the divine) how 
you want your day to unfold is via segment intending.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   144Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   144 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
Phase 5 :  MaSTerING YOur DaY
145
For the Skeptics and Optimists
If you’re new to this whole concept and are a little skeptical, Esther 
advises that you start by saying, “Wouldn’t it be nice if . . .” followed 
by your intention. That way, you’re still engaging in the segment 
manifestation process while honoring your healthy doubt. For ex -
ample, “Wouldn’t it be nice if my boss appreciated me in our meeting 
today.”
On the other hand, if you’re already a big believer in the power of 
your own mind, go for a command. For example, “T oday, my favor-
ite song, ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ is going to play on the radio when 
I’m driving to work.”
Just play the game and see what happens.
I say, if you’ve got the confidence, use it. Your unshakable faith 
makes for an incredibly potent catalyst when it comes to daily mani-
festation. It’s like Jim Carrey said: “Hope is a beggar. Hope walks 
through the fire. Faith leaps over it.”
So come on, guys. Let’s be like Jim.
The Science Behind Why All This Works
Of course, all this begs the question . . . will this daily intention- 
setting embedded in the Six Phase Meditation, which asks only two 
minutes of your day, actually work?
In short, the answer is a resounding and unshakable yes.
Yes, this does work. And it does so thanks to one of your brain’s 
lesser- known magic tricks: the reticular activating system. I’ll refer to 
your reticular activating system from now on as the RAS.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   145Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   145 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION MeTHOD
146
In a nutshell, your RAS comprises a truckload of nerves that sit in 
your brain stem, just waiting to filter out any unuseful information 
from your surroundings. And thank goodness it does, because now 
more than ever we’re surrounded by the incessant, bright, flashy stim-
uli of the twenty- first century. It’s thanks to your RAS that all the 
important stuff— the voice of your loved one in a crowd, your job 
responsibilities, fire hazards, and threats, for example— get priori -
tized in your attention at the appropriate time.
So you could say, then, that the RAS takes whatever you want to 
focus on and creates a specific filter for it. It then sifts through all the 
incoming data during the day and presents only the pieces of infor -
mation that are important to you. Furthermore, this takes absolutely 
no effort on your part, as it’s all automatic. Amazing, right?
So when the biblical Saint Matthew warned us, “Seek, and ye 
shall find,” he wasn’t lying. What you focus on every day will come to 
you, and thanks to your RAS filter, your brain will stop at nothing to 
seek it out.
In most psychology papers that talk about the RAS, the example 
they tend to give is the one about white Volkswagens.
If you own a white Volkswagen and you’re driving it down the 
highway, you’re much more likely to notice other white Volkswagens 
cruising down the highway too. That’s because your brain is aware 
that you yourself are driving one. The same theory applies when you 
make a declaration about your day.
If you decide that you’re going to have an amazing lunch break 
filled with great food, even better company, and a beautiful ambi -
ance, you are commanding your brain to notice these things, in ad -
vance. And if you do happen to go to a restaurant and the waiter 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   146Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   146 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
 MaSTerING YOur DaY
147
messes up your order— say, they dared to serve you non- gluten- free 
bread— you’re more likely to ignore these imperfections. Your brain 
will be way too busy noticing the incredible taste of your guac and 
Monterey Jack cheese combo, the pretty candles, and the sparkling 
conversation.
Overall, when that lunch ends, despite being served the wrong 
food, you’re way more likely to perceive it as a great, highly successful 
lunch break, because that’s what you programmed your brain to do. 
Period.
Does this make you a bit delusional?
Yes.
But it also makes you a happier person and puts you in an infi -
nitely better mood on a day- to- day basis. I’m all for that kind of de-
lusional behavior. I’d rather be joyfully deluded than bitchy, negative, 
and whiny over tiny things that bother negative people every day.
The Spiritual Standpoint
Now that you’ve enjoyed the unadulterated science, here’s the 
spiritual standpoint.
When we set an intention for how we want something to unfold, 
many spiritual teachers believe that it’s more likely to manifest organi-
cally. It’s called deliberate creation and works according to the Law of 
Attraction, which we briefly touched on in the previous chapter.
This theory has less hard science to back it up, but those who 
advocate this concept say that when we make a decision, it becomes 
a cosmic choice that directly moves us into that potential future.
Esther takes this idea further, and makes it all the more beautiful, 
claiming that when we connect to the magic of manifestation, we 
become creative Gods enjoying the experience of being human.

The Added Feel- Good Bonuses of Phase 5
When you decide to have a great day, it has a big ripple effect. Great 
days end up evolving into great weeks. Great weeks then evolve into 
great months, and great months to great years. And great years evolve 
into an absolutely epic life.
It all starts with making a firm decision in two minutes during the 
Six Phase Meditation on how you’re going to seize the day.
As well as setting yourself up for an awesome day (and life) filled 
with more optimism and joy, Phase 5 also feels incredibly pleasurable 
in real time.
Just like Phase 4, A Vision for Your Future, Phase 5 is another 
kid- in- a- candy- store opportunity. Remember the best part— your 
brain has no idea that these incredible things aren’t actually happen-
ing as you meditate. When you see a happy, flowing day in your 
mind’s eye, you’ll feel all the positive emotions that you’d feel if they 
were happening for real. Your emotional and physical body will react 
on a biochemical level.
Although it’s all just in your head (for now), the dopamine, sero-
tonin, oxytocin, and endorphins are real.
And when you’re all Nina Simone feeling good as you go about 
your day, other people will benefit too. Because every single person 
you come into contact with will share your positive vibes. Happiness 
is infectious. And that’s an infection humanity could do with right 
now.
Here’s the protocol.

The Mastering Y our Day Protocol
Step 1— Pull Up Y our Mental Screen
Imagine that huge TV screen right in front of you, where you can 
watch your day play out.
Remember what I told you about the segments? You’ll start from 
the beginning and proceed in chronological order. If you’re stuck on 
where to start, it’s worth remembering what you chose to focus on 
previously for your three- year goal in Phase 4. Then you can integrate 
a small step toward it into your daily routine.
Say in Phase 4 you imagined becoming a world- renowned author. 
In this phase, you might see yourself spending an hour of your up -
coming day in your favorite café, working on your book ideas, as one 
of your segments.
If you envisioned a fit, healthy body, see yourself taking a step 
toward that goal at some point in your day. Maybe you’ll see yourself 
making a green smoothie or going for a long walk on your lunch 
break; whatever fits.
If you aren’t practicing first thing in the morning (which is rec -
ommended), don’t worry; just start imagining what’s going to hap -
pen after you open your eyes from the meditation.
Step 2—  See and Feel Y our Entire Day Going Amazingly
Now you’ll see the chronological movie of your day from morning till 
night.
Just like you did in the previous phase, you’ll see, hear, taste, 
smell, and feel your upcoming day play out to perfection. At the be-

THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION MeTHOD
ginning of every segment, don’t forget to set a verbal intention, such 
as “My breakfast will be nutritious and fill me with energy,” all the 
way to “My sleep will be deep and restorative.”
This is your time of dedicated daydreaming for your day. Don’t be 
afraid to be optimistic, even if it feels like having a great day is an 
impossible feat due to the challenges that may await you. Be brave 
and have faith that the highest and best is going to manifest and that 
you’ll be that healing presence on whichever room you enter.
If nothing else, have faith in the science and your brain’s reticular 
activating system. This is anything but a waste of time.
So there you have it. You’ve completed Phase 5. I love this phase be-
cause it’s bringing you from meditation to action. After all, the Six 
Phase Meditation is not meant to be one of those meditations where, 
when you come out, you feel all floaty and ready for a nap. It’s meant 
to be a meditation that relaxes you but gets you ready to conquer the 
world.
There’s a big difference.
Who knew that you could simply decide to have a kick- ass day? 
Don’t you wish they had taught us this stuff at school? When I learned 
that I could choose how my days would unfold as well as (most of) 
the events that came to be, I became an infinitely happier man. It 
empowered me.
Sure, nobody has ever asked that pigeon to poop on their wind -
shield, but what they can choose is where their brain laser- focuses its 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   150Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   150 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

attention. What they can choose is to train their optimism, positivity, 
and mind- set for the day ahead.
Can you imagine what would happen if each and every person 
woke up in the morning with the intention to have a beautiful day? 
T o make themselves and others happy? T o eat well, be mindful, and 
enjoy the seemingly mundane? T o invest, even if it’s just a little, in 
their long- term goals with a tiny step per day?

PHASE 6
The Blessing
You can search the entire universe and  
not find a single being more worthy of love than you.
Gautama Buddha
When I designed the Six Phase Meditation, I wanted to create some-
thing rooted in science.
Because now more than ever, what humanity needs is the com -
pass of science to help us distinguish snake oil from real medicine.
Having said that, science cannot explain everything, can it?
You’ve come to the only phase of the Six Phase Meditation that 
will be a little threadbare in terms of solid, black- and- white evidence. 
But I still want you to partake in this short exercise— that of receiving 
a blessing from a higher power to commemorate your meditation 
practice.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   153Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   153 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION MeTHOD
It just so happens that the very subjects that science can’t (yet) 
explain are also crucial to fill our lives with meaning. And although 
there’s no conclusive research to prove that there’s a higher power, a 
loving presence that’s watching over us, 84 percent of humanity 
nonetheless believes this is the case.
That’s because, at times against logic, we somehow feel it, sense it, 
and intuit it.
I, for one, believe to my core that I’m connected to a higher en -
ergy. That’s not to say that I’m religious. I absolutely don’t believe in 
the idea of an old bearded man in the sky who’s judging my every 
move. Rather, my personal spiritual practice is a mixture of many of 
the world’s religions plus some modern conveniences. I really don’t 
believe in having just one religion— that idea just seems unnatural to 
me when there’s so much beauty and wisdom to be found in all of 
them. That said, none of the rituals, philosophies, and practices that 
resonate with me define my spirituality either.
So, although I definitely believe in a higher energy, my word for 
It is pretty interchangeable. God, Goddess, the Universe, the Great 
Spirit, my Spirit, Pachamama, Lord Shiva, Archangel Michael, the 
morphogenetic field, the Higher Self, Gaia, my Higher Self— you 
name it, I’ll be fine with it.
Because really, in my eyes, we’re all talking about the same thing.
And I believe that “thing,” that energy, is something that we’re 
plugged into at all times. I believe it’s something that supports us, 
nurtures us, and has our back.
Like I said, although there’s no solid proof, there are countless 
people who’ve claimed to have experienced the presence of God.

Phase 6 : THe Ble SSING
Some speak of angels, guides, and feelings of samadhi— in particular 
those who’ve had near- death experiences.
So do we dismiss these people’s stories because we haven’t yet been 
able to replicate them in a lab?
Michael Beckwith on the Power of Asking for 
Divine Intervention
In November 2017, I listened to a story from Reverend Michael 
Beckwith that inspired me to think about life and the concept of 
“God” in a new way. Michael was onstage at A- Fest, in the middle of 
another one of his mind- blowing speeches when it happened, but to 
be honest, I wasn’t really paying attention.
A- Fest was my festival, you see, and I was backstage syncing with 
the sound engineers, ensuring that everything in the auditorium was 
running like clockwork.
But there was this moment when, as I was speaking to the crew, I 
suddenly felt very compelled to pay attention to what Michael was 
saying, and stopped midsentence. And at that particular moment in 
his talk, he was telling the audience about a time he’d nearly drowned 
just off the coast of Costa Rica.
Michael was swimming with his daughter when he was violently 
dragged away from shore by a totally unexpected riptide. Being an 
older man, he knew he didn’t have the strength he had in his youth, 
and he quickly realized that he wasn’t going to make it back to shore.
“Just keep swimming. Do not pay attention to the body. Just keep 
swimming,” he repeated to himself over and over, attempting to calm 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   155Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   155 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

156
himself as he got dunked under the colossal waves again, swallowing 
a cruel amount of seawater.
It was at that moment that Michael said the words:
Help me.
Now, Michael claims these words didn’t come out of his mouth 
consciously. Moreover, there was nobody physically coming to help 
him. The only person around for miles was his daughter, who was 
now far away and safe on the beach.
After what felt like hours of underwater chaos, there was a quiet 
lull.
And from this divine silence, Michael shared that a small wave 
came up from behind him to give him a taste of forward momentum. 
Then another wave came, a little bigger this time. Then a third wave 
gave him some more momentum until finally, exhausted and injured, 
he managed to scramble his way onto the sand and into his daugh -
ter’s arms.
Thank you, God. Thank you to whatever name you want to be 
called.
A few days later Michael began telling a friend of his, who also 
happens to be a medium, about his experience in Costa Rica. Before 
he could even get to the part where he got dragged under the riptide, 
his friend asked, “Can I look?” with a knowing glimmer in her eye.
After giving her the go- ahead, the medium saw the scene in her 
mind’s eye. “Wow! You, you asked for help out loud, right?” Michael 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   156Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   156 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

nodded. She continued, “When you asked for help at that moment, 
an archangel swooped down and ruffled the water . . . three times for 
you to get out . . . ?”
That’s exactly what happened, he whispered. Three waves pushed 
him to shore.
Michael shared with us that the whole experience had taught him 
a very powerful lesson: to have the humility to ask for help. And no 
help can be given from the ancestral, shamanic, divine, angelic (what-
ever you call it) realm to this physical dimension unless you do so 
clearly and directly.
Because while it’s important to program your mind for success, 
just like you’ve done in the previous five phases of this book, it’s also 
vital for us to be open to receiving help to make sure it happens.
Like Michael learned, there are always forces around us ready to 
help; we just have to ask. In his words, AQ (your availability quotient 
to that higher power) always trumps IQ (the mind’s intellectual abil-
ity to manifest as a standalone force).
So that’s what this final section of the Six Phase Meditation is all 
about.
Expanding Y our Availability Quotient
Although this phase is called “the blessing,” it doesn’t mean you’re in 
for an enforced conversion. Nobody is going to flick holy water on 
your forehead against your will.
But the blessing does have its place here. As most people believe 
in a higher power, I thought it appropriate to honor that and make it 
an integral part of the Six Phase Meditation.

Furthermore, it takes only a few seconds. You’ll imagine a beauti-
ful light coming down from the sky that represents your higher 
power. You’ll then allow it to encapsulate your body before fully re -
ceiving the blessing (or in other words, the help you need).
In addition to honoring the spiritual beliefs of the meditator, I 
also included the blessing to bring a tangible close to the entire med-
itative practice so we set ourselves up for the day feeling complete and 
supported in our intentions.
But it was actually one of my most respected mentors, Srikumar 
Rao, who led to the final decision to include it.
Srikumar Rao is an internationally acclaimed business school pro-
fessor, TED speaker, bestselling author, and founder of the Rao Insti-
tute. Commonly known as the “Buddha of business,” Srikumar has 
taught at   the London Business School, the Kellogg School of Man -
agement at Northwestern University, and the Haas School of Busi -
ness at the University of California at Berkeley. And he has a way of 
combining spiritual wisdom with entrepreneurship in a way I’ve 
never seen before.
Having taught hundreds of MBA students to achieve success by 
refining their personal philosophies and “mental models,” Srikumar 
is a major authority when it comes to living a fulfilling human exis -
tence.
When I was developing the Six Phase Meditation, I listened to a 
talk Srikumar was doing on the psychology of success and happiness. 
He was preaching about how your mental models— that is, what you 
believe to be true about the world— will directly influence your expe-
rience in it, be they positive or negative.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   158Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   158 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
159
Phase 6 : THe Ble SSING
At the end of the talk, Srikumar was asked, repeatedly, to define 
which mental model was the very best to have. This is what he said:
The most important belief you can possess is the belief that the 
universe loves you. If you believe that the universe is always 
working in your favor, you will have a beautiful experience in 
this life.
The word universe is replaceable, by the way, for whichever word 
you deem most appropriate.
After hearing Srikumar say that this was the ultimate mental 
model out of the billions of other singular beliefs one could choose, I 
knew I had to conclude this special sequence with the blessing.
I’m of the opinion that, after meditating on Phase 6 and then 
going forth into your day believing you’re not alone, believing you’re 
loved and supported, you’re in for an amazing time.
Not only that. Cumulatively, you’re in for an amazing life of won-
der and positivity.
The Blessing: Nobody Gets Left Behind
Now, if I may, I’d like to address those who choose not to believe in 
God (or any other word you might use to describe a higher power).
First, let me just say that I frickin’ love atheists. They’re some of 
the most interesting people I’ve ever met, with some of the sharpest 
minds out there, and being one doesn’t exempt you from Phase 6. 
Not by a long shot.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   159Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   159 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

160
I actually don’t believe in a separate “God” either. I’m more of a 
pantheist, having a reverence for the entire universe— which Richard 
Dawkins, author of The God Delusion , describes as “sexed- up athe-
ism.”
So, atheist or religious, everyone can reap the same feelings of 
calm, collectedness, and support from Phase 6. Because even if you’re 
a devout atheist, you can still connect to whatever power that you 
believe lies inside yourself.
Your inner power. Your resilience. Your inner reservoirs of 
strength. Your deep sense of knowing and wisdom. Your heart. Your 
brilliant mind.
Some people like to envision their older, wiser selves blessing 
them and supporting them. Go ahead and time travel twenty years 
ahead and draw inspiration from them.
Whatever you choose, you’ll allow the best version of yourself to 
conclude your practice.
It’s Y our Turn to Receive Support
This part of the Six Phase Meditation, as I said, is the shortest, easiest 
phase. But it can also be the most relaxing and pleasurable. It pro -
vides a refreshing contrast to the previous five phases.
If you think about it, up to now you’ve been pretty busy giving. 
You’ve been actively focusing on other people, sending your energy 
outward. You’ve meditated on compassion and gratitude. You’ve for-
given an asshole who hurt you. You poured your attention into what 
you want to manifest in three years’ time, as well as how you want 
your day to unfold.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   160Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   160 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
Phase 6 : THe Ble SSING
161
Phase 6 is your moment to be pleasantly passive, allowing some -
one/something else to envelop you in love and attention. And who 
better to do it than . . . the universe?
You’ll connect with this abundant energy to not only bless your 
practice, integrating all of the previous five phases, but to make you 
feel supported as you take your first step into a brand new day.
Because being human is pretty hard- core. Outside the comfort -
able confines of our bedroom walls where we start the day await po -
tential challenges, roadblocks, and triggers. And no matter what your 
spiritual beliefs are, I feel we can all agree that we need support to 
navigate all of the good, the bad, and the ugly.
T o prosper, unlock our inner genius, hit our goals, and jump into 
the unknown, we need all that energy. And the good news is that 
your higher power, or higher self, has it in bucketloads. It’s infinite. 
The blessings will never run out. You just have to be open to receiving 
them.
The Blessing Protocol
Step 1— Call on Y our Higher Power
Take a deep breath in and take a second to connect to your higher 
power, whatever that may be.
T ry and feel the presence of your God/Goddess/spiritual force/
higher self as opposed to thinking your way through the exercise and 
diving into a whole cognitive process about it. We’re activating what 
Michael Beckwith described as your AQ (your availability quotient) 
here as opposed to your IQ.
Once you’ve forged a connection, it’s time to invite in a blessing.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   161Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   161 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

162
Step 2—  Feel Y our Higher Power as a Beam of Loving 
Light
Now imagine that blessing from your higher power as a beautiful 
golden or white light shining down from above. Feel the light. Sense 
the brightness and the comforting warmth of it, knowing it’s filled 
with infinite power and energy.
Know that, within this blessing, is the official signal from the 
universe to go forth into your day and carpe diem. It’s saying, “Yeah, 
all those intentions are fine by me, here’s all the energy you’ll need to 
make it happen.” It’s a confirmation that you’re not alone. So let it in.
(If you’re an atheist, this is the part where you call upon your 
inner power or an older, wiser version of yourself. Imagine you can 
feel their presence as this light too.)
Step 3—  Allow the Light to Flow Through Y ou
From there, imagine this light traveling its way through your head 
and going down your spine.
Then imagine the light expanding from your body to form a bub-
ble around you. Imagine yourself enveloped in a shield of this loving, 
infinitely powerful light from your higher power, knowing that it’s 
going to be with you for the rest of your day to protect you from 
negativity, support you, and fill you with all the qualities you need to 
flourish. This is your blessing.

Phase 6 : THe Ble SSING
163
Step 4— Thank Y our Higher Power
Know that all your visions and intentions are now backed up by God/
the most badass version of yourself.
Take a second to enjoy that feeling and thank your (higher) 
power. You may bring the protocol to a close by using a mantra or 
prayer from your religion. Prayer hands, bow, cheeky smile, a whis -
pered “thank you,” whatever you choose.
Alternatively, you could close the protocol the way I do it and top 
it off with an imaginary fist- pump to the universe. Then you’re ready 
to gently bring yourself out of the meditation and get on with your 
amazing day.
Soak it all in and harness that blessing completely so you can go 
out there and kick butt with confidence.
Step 5— Close Y our Meditation
Now you’ll bring yourself out of the meditation after a count of five 
seconds.
If you are using the app to listen to the audio- guided meditation, 
I’ll count you out gently, Silva Method– style. Here is the exact script 
I’ll use:
I will now count from one to five. When I reach the count of 
five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and 
in perfect health.
 . . . One
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   163Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   163 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

 . . . Two
 . . . Three
Ready to open your eyes, feeling fine, and in perfect health.
 . . . Four
 . . . Five
Eyes open. Wide awake. Feeling fine and in perfect health. 
Feeling better than before.
And that’s it. You’re done. You’ve done everything you need to do to 
reach ultimate peace and happiness.
You’ve experienced connection with the world via compassion. 
You’ve enjoyed the feeling of fullness via gratitude. You’ve cleansed 
your soul of negative charges through forgiveness. You’ve set an amaz-
ing vision for your future— one you truly want. You’ve asked for a 
perfect day. And you’ve brought it all together with a blessing from 
that indescribable force that has traveled with you since the day you 
were born, and that will continue to be with you until the day you 
die.
Phase 6 takes only a few seconds, but it’s worth its weight in gold, 
because any time we spend connected to something greater than our-
selves is time well spent.
After all, we’re so used to being the stars of our own show, we 
forget that we’re not alone. No matter what you believe in, be it a 
God or a badass, an older and wiser version of yourself, you’re sup -
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   164Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   164 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

ported. And in order to succeed, to realize your true potential, you 
need that support.
So rely on a higher power.
Rely on that place deep within yourself that is infinitely powerful 
beyond measure.
Rely on one, the other, or both.
It doesn’t matter.
Because one of the most ancient truths we’ll ever learn is that 
there’s no difference between the two.
Open up your Mindvalley app and launch the Six Phase Meditation 
program. From there, you can jump into the full interactive lesson 
for Phase 6: The Blessing. The lesson is just a few minutes long and 
will recap some of the most important points in this chapter. Upon 
completion, you can then dive straight into the meditation audio 
where I’ll guide you through the blessing protocol. It will take less 
than five minutes but will help lock in the sixth phase of your prac -
tice.
This is the final phase of the Six Phase Meditation, so after you’ve 
consolidated your knowledge, you’re ready to start meditating on the 
entire sequence. You’ll find the full Six Phase audio on the Mindval-
ley app (both on your Six Phase mini- program and on the meditation 
tab).

Chapter 7
FROM PRACTICE TO MASTERY
The Final Word
A few years ago, I invited a brilliant man to give a talk at my office.
He went by the name of T om Chi. You may well have heard of 
him. He’s the cofounder of Google X and creator of the world’s first 
prototype of the Google Glass augmented- reality device. This guy 
was an all- around genius, renowned for his ability to answer human-
ity’s toughest questions in a way that combined cutting- edge science 
and deep, spiritual philosophy.
From the existence of God to virus evolution, T om Chi and I 
would have many amazing discussions on stage together as well as on 
the Mindvalley podcast. I respect his work profusely.
On that particular day when T om visited Mindvalley’s office in 
Kuala Lumpur, he’d decided to give a talk on exponential technology 
and where the world was headed. My team was fascinated, and as the 
talk spilled over into a quick- fire Q&A, a brilliant employee of mine 
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   167Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   167 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

raised his hand and asked a question. It was this question, and its 
answer, that inspired my personal aspirations and goals in this life -
time.
“T om, what’s one thing you think we really need to be obsessed 
about to help make this world a better one?”
He paused for a few seconds. Then he responded:
“We need to create an exponential rise in human consciousness.”
T om went on to explain that the exponential technologies that are 
chartering the course of our future are becoming increasingly more 
powerful and dangerous. Nowadays, anyone can surf the dark web, 
buy themselves some C4 explosives, strap them to a $99 drone, and 
fly it into a building. And then with the push of a button, blow that 
building to smithereens with everyone in it.
The only thing preventing them from doing that? Their level of 
consciousness.
If we carry on this way, constantly scaling our technology while 
remaining stagnant in our consciousness evolution, a dark future 
awaits.
In other words, if we don’t raise human consciousness, we’re done 
for.
“Absolutely DONE for!” T om emphasized.
Therefore, the biggest mission that we can ever embark on is the 
one that aims to level up human consciousness. T o do so we need to 
understand that we’re really in a great tug- of- war between two oppos-
ing evolutionary versions of the human mind.

The Primitive Mind vs. the Higher Mind
In his famous article “The Great Battle of Fire and Light,” globally 
celebrated blogger (and one of my favorite philosophers) Tim Urban 
explains that being human is a constant battle between what he de -
scribes as the “Primitive Mind” and the “Higher Mind.”
Far too often in the world today, we operate from the Primitive 
Mind.
The Primitive Mind could be seen as our ancestral animalistic 
software, which, contrary to what many choose not to believe, still 
resides as strongly as ever. It’s the eat, procreate, repeat program. On 
the other hand, we have the Higher Mind— the highly advanced 
consciousness where all the ethical, wise, and spiritual magic hap -
pens.
The Chinese, and many others, would describe the Higher Mind 
as the heart and the Primitive Mind as the ego, but for the sake of this 
book, we’ll follow Tim’s definition.
The Primitive Mind experiences daily life in survival mode, in 
lack, and in competition. The Higher Mind lives life with presence, 
gratitude, and compassion.
The Primitive Mind believes struggle and competition are the 
keys to survival. The Higher Mind knows that we can tap into the 
power of positive thought and intention to manifest the futures we 
desire.
The Primitive Mind is protective and loving only to those of the 
same family creed. The Higher Mind sees the illusions of borders, 
race, ethnicity, and culture and feels compassion toward all human 
beings, no matter how different they may appear.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   169Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   169 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

170
The Primitive Mind drowns in negativity bias. The Higher Mind 
embraces all emotions and integrates them in a healthy way in the 
name of personal evolution.
The Primitive Mind is wild and untrainable. The Higher Mind is 
flexible, centered, and open.
The Primitive Mind feels alone in the world.
The Higher Mind sees the intricate connection between all life on 
Earth and understands that we are all part of something much bigger 
than ourselves.
The Higher Mind and the Six Phase Meditation
So you see, the Six Phase Meditation was designed specifically to 
move us toward the Higher Mind. Although we need some elements 
of it for our survival (such as our ability to fight or flee), ironically, the 
Primitive Mind that desperately attempts to keep us alive as individu-
als has the potential to end up destroying the human race.
So if we want to expand our level of consciousness to match the 
scarily high technological bar we’ve set, we need to activate the Higher 
Mind. Fast.
So that, reader, was the secret agenda behind teaching you the Six 
Phase Meditation.
Because it turns out that all of the phases of this meditation— 
compassion, gratitude, forgiveness, humanity plus goal setting, and 
spirituality— don’t just have the potential to save your skin as an in-
dividual. Meditating this way as a collective could end up saving us 
all.

Adding Our “Grain of Sand” to the Great Beach
Now that you’re chewing on this newfound knowledge regarding the 
future of humanity, technology, and world- peace- inspiring higher 
consciousness, you might feel extra motivated to keep yourself on the 
straight and narrow with your meditation practice.
But I didn’t set out to overwhelm you.
Fundamentally, you start off your meditation for yourself. And 
that’s enough. It’s more than enough.
You deserve love, peace, and happiness just as much as the next 
human, and this meditation will bring you that. You don’t have to go 
violently protesting in the street against AI, whip plastic straws out of 
people’s mouths, and walk barefoot around San Francisco in an at -
tempt to show that you care about the Earth.
There’s a beautiful, commonly used Spanish phrase that encom -
passes the value of small changes and how they end up being huge in 
the long term:
Hay que poner cada uno su granito de arena.
“Every individual must contribute their own grain of 
sand.”
Meaning, if everyone throws in one tiny grain of sand, ultimately, 
that’s how you get a beach worth visiting.
If every single individual meditated tomorrow morning, felt a 
sense of compassion and belonging, felt grateful and cleansed of re -
sentment, and summoned the strength and inspiration to go out into 
the world and contribute, living every day as if it were their last . . .

 . . . can you imagine what an amazing place this planet would be?
But before that happens, we’re going to need some strong pio -
neers who perfect their inner worlds so they can make a difference in 
the outer world.
And that starts with you.
Y our Journey Begins
Now that you know what your mission is, should you choose to ac -
cept it, let’s close this book and get on with meditating our way to 
human happiness and planetary sustainability.
The Six Phase Meditation is just the beginning of your beautiful 
personal growth journey. Once you go deeper into the Six Phase 
Meditation, you will be compelled to start enhancing, optimizing, 
and improving every aspect of yourself. So I encourage you to prac -
tice on a daily basis.
Many people do the Six Phase for hundreds of days in a row, and 
I take my hat off to them. That’s optimal. But look, if you miss a day, 
it’s not a big deal. The last thing I want to do is put another mindless 
checkbox on your to- do list.
Do this for you. Do it because it makes you feel good. Do it be -
cause it’s going to support you as you shine your light into the world.
This meditation is by far the most effective thing I do every single 
day of my life, and I truly hope it becomes as much of a lifeline for 
you as it has for me.
So, this is my gift to you. As I’ve said throughout the book, the 
Six Phase Meditation is completely free of charge on all the platforms 
we use, and it always will be. Furthermore, I want you to feel com -
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   172Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   172 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

pletely free to take it, hack it, change it, tweak it, teach it to your 
friends, squeeze it into five minutes, prolong it for thirty, do whatever 
you want. But there’s one rule.
Make sure you get in touch with me to tell me what you did.
The Six Phase Meditation is always evolving (it’s already changed 
a lot in the past eight years) and I’m always looking to refine it so I 
can get it out there to as many people as possible. If this approach 
enhances your life, please help me get the word out by sharing your 
story on http://stories.mindvalley.com.
Closing Word: Never Give Up
Before we close out, I want to leave you with one piece of advice.
Keep going.
Even when it seems like you’re plateauing a year later, even when 
it seems like you don’t “need” the Six Phase anymore, keep meditat-
ing.
Just like physical exercise, it will always be good for you. You don’t 
stop walking, dancing, and lifting weights when you’ve got the body 
you always wanted, right? You keep training to maintain that hot 
body. It’s the same with your mind.
John Davy, the brilliant entrepreneur behind Jongleurs, a world- 
famous chain of comedy clubs based in the United Kingdom, once 
told me that he practiced the Six Phase Meditation for a hundred 
days in a row.
After one hundred days, it goes without saying that meditating 
started to feel quite normal. He wasn’t noticing the huge shifts he was 
before, so he decided to stop. He was a busy man, after all.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   173Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   173 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

174
Only thereafter, his colleagues and friends began gradually ap -
proaching him with concern.
“John, are you okay?”
“John, there’s something up.”
“John, are you off your medication?”
He wasn’t even on any to begin with. He had no idea what they 
were talking about. But his friends shared that they’d noticed that 
he’d become more fidgety and was visibly returning to old, anxious 
patterns.
He realized that it had been his meditation practice counteracting 
those unhealthy habits and regulating his energy and success as a 
leader. Needless to say, he returned to his practice.
So keep going when the going is easy. But you also want to keep 
going when things go wrong. Especially when things go wrong.
I really wish I could wave a magic wand and assure you that, be -
cause you bought this book, you’ll become the twenty- first- century 
incarnation of the Buddha or a younger version of Gandhi. That’s to 
say that you’ll instantly become so enlightened that nothing will ever 
bother you again. That you’ll never get your heart broken again; that 
you’ll never suffer loss, stress, and turbulence. That you’ll never expe-
rience resistance to meditation. That you’ll never dread sitting in a 
quiet room with your own head when you’re at your worst.
I can’t wave that magic wand, and neither would it be just.
Because sometimes— a lot of the time, actually— it’s through pain 
that we extract our deepest wisdom and inner knowing. We will al -
ways grow through what we go through if we’re open to becoming 
bigger than what happens “to” us and to upleveling our conscious -
ness.

No, I don’t know what’s in store for you when you close this 
book, nor do I know what’s in store for me when I finish writing it.
But I do know one thing.
I know that no matter what, we now have a set of skills that won’t 
just allow us to survive our biggest setbacks— we have a set of skills 
that will enable us to thrive, achieve, and prosper as a species.

The Six Phase  
Meditation Transcript
This final section includes my script for the Six Phase Meditation in 
this book to allow you to practice this meditation in educational con-
texts and to provide extra accessibility for readers who may be deaf or 
hard of hearing.
Welcome to the Six Phase Meditation.
I’m Vishen Lakhiani, and I’m going to gently guide you through 
all six phases of this exercise.
We will begin with Phase 1: Compassion. I want you to bring to 
mind someone whom you truly love. This may be a family member, 
a friend, a lover, or even a pet.
See this soul in front of you. And as you do so, feel the love that 
they fill you with. Feel that love in your heart.
Now, give this love a color. Perhaps a light green, pink, white, or 
blue.

Now take a deep breath. And as you exhale, imagine this light of 
love expanding from your heart area to fill your entire body.
Take another deep breath. And as you do, feel the light of this 
love move out from beyond your body to fill the room that you’re 
currently in.
And as this light expands to fill the room, imagine this feeling of 
love emanating from you to all life in the room; to every person, 
every pet, even every plant.
Now take a deep breath. And as you exhale, imagine this light of 
love filling the entire building, touching everything that represents 
life within the building.
Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, imagine this love emanat-
ing further to cover the entire city you’re in. You may feel a sense of 
the city or see the city as if you were looking at it on a map. See the 
city covered in the light of this love and compassion.
Again take a deep breath. And as you exhale, feel this light of love 
fill the entire country that you’re in. As you did for your city, you may 
see the country as if you’re looking at it on a map, or you could even 
bring to mind your nation’s flag.
Imagine your love and compassion emanating from your heart to 
every human being, animal, and plant within this country.
Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, allow your love and 
compassion to expand so much that it covers the entire planet.
See the entire globe in front of you with all its countries, people, 
animals, and plants covered with the light of your love.
You may even repeat a blessing or a mantra for every living crea -
ture on Earth, such as:

May you be well, may you be free of suffering, may you be at peace.
You’ve now completed Phase 1.
We now move to Phase 2: Gratitude.
I want you to bring to mind three things that you’re grateful for 
in your personal life.
They could have happened in the past day, week, month, year, or 
even years ago. As you reflect on those three things, focus on the 
emotions they bring out in you. Feel the joy, the love, the lightness, 
and the appreciation that you felt the moment you received these 
gifts or lived these experiences.
Now think about your work life. Think about three things that 
you can be grateful for in your career that perhaps happened within 
the last twenty- four hours or seven days.
Whether you’re appreciating a kind word from a coworker, a proj-
ect going well, or the income you made, feel all the positive emotions 
and give thanks.
And now we moved to the third level of gratitude: gratitude for 
yourself.
Think about three aspects of your being. These could be related to 
your body, your mind, aspects of your personality, anything you’re 
grateful for about yourself.
Give thanks and gratitude for these three aspects of yourself, feel-
ing the joy and the positive emotions as you bring to mind each 
unique aspect of you.

We now come to Phase 3: Forgiveness.
Think of some incident or some occasion that caused a negative 
charge to build within you. It could be something small, or some -
thing big. But if you’re just starting out, start with something minor. 
See that person whom you need to forgive standing in front of you in 
a safe space in your mind.
It could be a beach, a forest, or a garden, wherever you feel safe.
Look at them and express how you feel. T ell them exactly what 
they did to harm or betray you as if you were reading the charge out 
in court.
For a few moments, allow yourself to feel the pain.
Now stop focusing on the pain and again draw your attention to 
the person who wronged you. T ry to see it from their eyes, as difficult 
as this may initially seem. Think about how they may have perceived 
the situation. You can go further and think about what they could 
have experienced in their life that caused them to behave in this way. 
Remember, hurt people hurt people.
After you’ve seen the situation from their eyes, reflect on what you 
may have learned from this incident.
How did it help you grow? Did this incident help you become 
stronger or wiser?
And now, as you see this person in front of you, choose to forgive 
them.
If you can, imagine giving them a hug as a symbol of your for -
giveness.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   180Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   180 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

181
You may repeat this process with the same incident and the same 
person every day as you do the Six Phase, depending on the gravity of 
the incident. When you feel like you can hug the person with no 
negative charge, you can move on to another person.
We now come to Phase 4: A Vision for Your Future. I want you to 
bring to mind your visions and your dreams for your life three years 
ahead.
Remember, we often overestimate what we can do in one year, 
but underestimate what we can do in three. So visualize your life 
three years from now as if it were a movie playing out on a screen in 
front of you. Bring to mind any area of your life that you care about.
You may run through a perfect scene of your life three years from 
now, or you may choose two or three specific goals that you have for 
yourself. These could be connected to your career, your love life, your 
health, your fitness, where you wish to travel . . . they could be goals 
linked to your personal growth or spirituality.
Either way, make the visions of these goals as vivid as you can. 
Bring in all five senses. What do you see? If your vision isn’t your 
dominant sense, what can you hear? What can you smell? What sen-
sations and feelings can you feel?
Think about this goal as if it’s already happening.
I will give you a few minutes to linger with your future visions. 
Remember to bring in all five senses.
What do you see?
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   181Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   181 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM

182
What do you hear?
What do you feel, smell, and taste?
Who else is in the scene with you?
It helps to see other people benefit from your accomplishments.
As you wrap up, know that this future vision is on its way to you.
We now go to Phase 5: Mastering Your Day.
Think of your day as a series of stages or segments. You’re about 
to see each section unfold with perfect intention.
We’ll start with your morning just after you’ve completed your 
meditation. If you’re meditating at night, this will be the morning 
you’re waking up to.
Set an intention for how you would want your morning to un -
fold.
What’s the first thing you’re doing? Perhaps you see your morning 
exercises going wonderfully. Maybe you taste your delicious, nourish-
ing breakfast on your tongue . . . see your working, studying, or lei -
sure day going perfectly. See the time progressing— 9 a.m., 10 a.m., 
11 a.m. . . . 
See smiling faces around you; see beautiful synchronicities com -
ing to pass and feelings of ease and joy.
See your lunchtime going beautifully, feeling inspired, deeply 
connected with yourself and those around you, peaceful and positive.
You may bring to mind specific meetings or events you have hap-
pening during the day and set an intention for each of these to flow 
as you’d like them to.
Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   182Lakh_9780593234648_all_1p_r1.indd   182 4/11/22   9:33 AM4/11/22   9:33 AM
THe SIX PHa Se MeDITaTION TraNScrIPT  
183
See the time progressing— 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m. . . . 
As you wrap up your day, perhaps see yourself returning home or 
meeting with loved ones, enjoying laughter, relaxation, joy, and hap-
piness.
See your evening time going wonderfully.
And now see yourself going to bed, about to have a wonderful, 
refreshing, healthy night’s sleep.
You’ve now completed Phase 5.
We now go to Phase 6: The Blessing.
You’ll now ask for a blessing to conclude your practice and to sup-
port you on your life’s journey today.
Take a moment to connect to whatever higher power you believe 
in, whether that’s a certain deity, the universe, the “field”— whichever 
word you use to describe your higher power. If you’re an atheist, see 
an older, wiser version of yourself blessing you and your intentions.
Imagine this blessing as a beautiful golden or white light shining 
down from above. Allow this light to travel its way through your head 
all the way down your spine, all the way down to the tips of your toes.
Now, imagine this light expanding from your body to form a 
bubble around you, enveloping you in a shield of loving, infinitely 
powerful light sent by your higher power. Know that this blessing 
will be with you for the rest of your day to protect you from negativ-
ity, support you, and fill you with all the qualities you need to flour-
ish.
This is your blessing.
You have now completed the Six Phase Meditation.

I’m now going to count from one to five. When I reach the count of 
five, you’ll be wide awake, feeling wonderful, in perfect health, feel -
ing better than before.
One, two, three . . . get ready to open your eyes at the count of 
five feeling wonderful, in perfect health, feeling better than before, 
four, five . . . eyes open, wide awake, feeling alert, wonderful, posi -
tive, refreshed, better than before.
This is Vishen Lakhiani, and thank you for joining me in the Six 
Phase Meditation.
