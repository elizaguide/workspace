BEFORE YOU BEG IN: KNOW THAT 
THIS IS NOT YO UR TY PIC AL BOOK
I
n fact, I would be hesitant to call this a personal growth book. It’s more 
of a personal disruption book. This book forces you to rethink aspects of 
your life that may have been running on autopilot for years.
Which means that within months of reading this book, you may find 
yourself no longer accepting certain aspects of your current reality. Your 
relationships, your career, your goals, your spiritual beliefs may all be 
forced to change as you come to understand that many of your beliefs and 
past decisions were never taken on by choice—but were installed by default.
This book is designed to disrupt the way you see the world and to give 
you the tools to shift the world through cognitive changes in your mind. In 
short, it creates an awakening. Once you see the patterns this book unveils, 
you cannot “unsee” them.
Depending on your worldview, you will either love this book or hate this 
book. That’s by design. It’s because we grow through discomfort or insight. 
But never through apathy.
In addition to the ideas it contains, this book is also unique in several ways:
NEW WORDS: This book contributes more than 20 new words to the 
English language. I had to create new words to describe (sometimes humor-
ously) the new models for living that you’ll be introduced to. Words are 
powerful, as they influence how we see the world. Once you understand 
these words, your perspective of certain things will change.
THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE: This book comes with its own custom-de -
signed app with hours of additional content, practices, training, and more. 
Do you especially like a particular idea from one of the thinkers I mention 
in the book—for example, Peter Diamandis? You can use the app to dive in 
deeper and listen to my full interview with him. Do you really enjoy a par -
ticular technique I share? The app will let you play a video of me guiding 
you through the technique. You’ll find gorgeous images, photos, ideas, and 
more, all on the Online Experience available for web, Android, and iOS. 
You can therefore read this book in a few hours, or you can choose to spend

days exploring and deep-diving into the full content. Access it from www.
mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
THE SOCIAL LEARNING PLATFORM: Since this book is about question-
ing life, as I wrote it, I began questioning the traditional ways books are 
made. One of my biggest annoyances with the idea of a “book” in today’s 
world is that you cannot easily interact with fellow readers or with the 
author. For this book, I decided to fix this flaw. I had my team develop a 
social learning platform to allow authors and readers to interact and learn 
from each other. This is the first of its kind in the world. You can interact 
with other readers, share ideas, and even communicate with me directly 
from your mobile device or computer when you sign up for the online expe-
rience. This makes this book perhaps one of the most technologically 
hooked-up volumes in history. You can access the Social Learning Platform 
via the Online Experience on www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
LEARNING METHODOLOGY: This book is designed to help you learn 
through a learning model upgrade I call Consciousness Engineering. Once 
you understand this, every idea in the book starts to connect. Furthermore, 
you’ll learn HOW TO learn. After reading this book, every other book you 
read on personal growth will make more sense and you’ll absorb their ideas 
better.
WRITING STYLE: My best and most meaningful conversations tend to 
happen with friends over a few drinks in a social setting. We’re vulnerable, 
we’re honest, we’re open, we’re transparent. When I have these conversa-
tions on life and business (often over a glass of wine), I love sketching on 
napkins to illustrate ideas. I bring this same style into this book. You’ll find 
the napkin illustrations, the personal stories, the raw vulnerability. I wrote 
things down I never thought I’d share publicly, but I share here because I 
feel others can learn from my errors.
COLLABORATION: This book involves more than 200 hours of inter -
views with many of the leading players on the world stage today. Arianna 
Huffington and Dean Kamen edited chapters. Richard Branson, Peter Dia -
mandis, Michael Beckwith, and Ken Wilber gave me hours of one-on-one 
discussions and interviews. I even got to pose a question (via my wife) to the 
Dalai Lama. I integrate all of these ideas into the Code because I consider 
these men and women to be role models we can all learn from.

THIS IS FOUR BOOKS IN ONE: I consider my time (and yours) precious, 
and I dislike reading personal growth books that drag on and on for 70,000 
words trying to teach a relatively simple concept. I have no wish to stretch 
out an idea—that just means wasted time for busy readers who understand 
concepts fast. So this book is really packed with knowledge. To offer you 
the best value possible, in each of the book’s four parts, I’ve tried to provide 
a richly detailed yet cohesive set of ideas. Each part stands well alone, yet 
together, they form a philosophy for living. My aim was to deliver maxi -
mum wisdom, in a fun way, in minimal time.

INTRODU CTION
I think it’s possible for ordinary people to choose to be 
extraordinary.
—ELON MUS K
I 
was going on stage to speak. But it was no ordinary stage. At this particu-
lar event in Calgary, Alberta, they had slotted me last—in a spot 
reserved for the least popular speakers. Before me, a whole procession 
of awe-inspiring names had taken the stage. His Holiness the Dalai 
Lama—who dished out wisdom like Yoda in orange robes. Then Nobel 
Prize winner F. W. de Klerk, former President of South Africa. Then Sir 
Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group. Followed by Tony Hsieh, 
CEO of Zappos.
And finally on day three, it was my turn. I was a gap filler—not a brand 
name that drew people to a conference like this but a random speaker slotted 
in to fill a space when budgets to book the big-name speakers were spent.
I stepped on stage to the biggest audience I had ever spoken to: waiting 
expectantly. I was nervous but had secretly downed a shot of vodka at the 
lobby bar to calm my nerves. My ripped jeans and untucked shirt bespoke 
nothing other than the fact that I was a man with poor fashion sense. I was 
thirty-three years old.
When I got on stage, I spoke about an idea very dear to me—about the 
way human beings view life, goals, happiness, and meaning. By the end, I 
saw that I had the audience in joy and in tears. Even more surprising, at the 
end of the conference, the audience had voted me best speaker. (I tied with 
Zappos’ Tony Hsieh.) This was a big deal, given the major names I was 
sharing that stage with and the fact that I had little experience as a speaker. 
But I had gotten more votes than the Dalai Lama (the fact that I take mild 
pride in this while he probably doesn’t care is the reason his title is His 
Holiness and mine is just Mr.).

I spoke that day about what it means to have an extraordinary life. It 
does not happen by chance, or through hard work, or through a unique set 
of skills. There is actually a methodology that anyone can employ—a code 
you can learn—that will catapult your life into the realm of the 
extraordinary.
These ideas have worked not just for a few individuals but also for hun-
dreds of thousands of people. This code is being used in schools around the 
world, in corporations to train their staff, and by individuals in countries 
all over the world to find meaning and happiness in their lives. It is a code 
that I have learned through trial and error and by paying very close atten -
tion to some of the most extraordinary people in the world.
My speech went on to get almost half a million views on YouTube 
despite being almost an hour long, and I received suggestions to write a 
book. But I didn’t feel I was ready. Who was I to be an author?
Then three years later, something else happened. I was sitting with Rich-
ard Branson on Necker Island after a party, and when most of the other 
guests had left and it was just the two of us, I shared with him some of my 
ideas and theories on what made him and others extraordinary. Branson 
turned to me and said, “You should write a book.” Branson wasn’t just an 
entrepreneur I admired. Because of his book Losing My Virginity , he was 
also my favorite author. This was the push I needed to get cracking on The 
Code of the Extraordinary Mind . It would still take another three years 
before the first chapter would be written. But the book is now complete, 
and I’m honored to place it in your hands.
I share these thoughts with you only to impress upon you how powerful 
the ideas in this book can be. This is not your typical personal growth 
book. In fact, it’s not a regular nonfiction book of any sort. It’s designed 
and written in a way to take really complex ideas (the keys to success, 
meaning, and happiness, for instance) and break them down into frame -
works and models that anyone can understand. And I mean anyone (as I 
was writing this, I received a video showing a teacher in India teaching 
some of the ideas in this book to several hundred Indian schoolchildren).
And these ideas work. If you knew my full background (more about that 
in the chapters to come), you would know that I should never have had the 
success I have today. The odds should have been squarely stacked against

me. Yet, I’ve been blessed to live a life that’s “extraordinary”—in short, a 
life that by reasonable odds I should never have experienced, including:
 ■ Turning a hobby—personal growth—into a company, Mindvalley, 
with 500,000 students, 2 million subscribers, and a passionate fan 
base that loves what we stand for.
 ■ Starting Mindvalley with no bank loans or venture capital and, 
despite impossible odds, building it into one of the most innovative 
companies in our space.
 ■ Creating an award-winning workplace that employs people from 
more than 40 countries and that was voted one of the coolest offices 
on the planet in 2012 in an Inc. magazine readers’ poll.
 ■ Marrying an incredible woman and having two wonderful kids we’re 
in the process of raising.
 ■ Starting my own festival, A-Fest, that takes place in exotic locations 
around the world and attracts thousands of incredible people to apply 
for sought-after tickets.
 ■ Experiencing spiritual awakenings that changed my understanding of 
physical reality.
 ■ Raising and donating millions of dollars for charities.
 ■ Getting an incredible offer to write this book (thank you, Rodale Inc.!).
Yet I can tell you with certainty that I was not born extraordinary. My 
life should have been fairly ordinary. I grew up in Malaysia before moving 
to the United States. I always considered myself a geek and dealt with 
self-esteem issues most of my life.
I almost flunked out of the University of Michigan, and just two years 
after graduation in 1999, I had the proud honor of being fired twice, losing 
my businesses twice, and being dead broke on multiple occasions.
I failed at over a dozen start-up ideas before one idea—Mindvalley—
clicked. Then, at age twenty-eight, I had to leave the country I dreamed of 
living in, and I moved back to my parents’ house. I spent the next six years 
struggling to get my little business going while living with my wife in a 
bedroom in my parents’ home and driving a tiny Nissan March.

Just one year before my speech in Calgary, I was nowhere close to 
accomplishing my goals. I was in greater debt than I would have been if I 
had never started my business.
And then at the age of thirty-two, I experienced a shift so powerful that in 
a few short years, my life went through a total and radical transformation.
All of this happened because despite my ordinary beginnings, I do have 
one unique skill that has served me time and again. It’s a skill I used to 
develop the framework for this book—a framework I’ve designed to help 
you step out of whatever ordinary circumstances you’d like to move beyond.
If I had to summarize this skill, it’s this—I’m a sponge when it comes to 
learning from others and connecting the dots. I am fortunate to have the 
ability to soak up knowledge and wisdom easily from all sorts of people—
from billionaires to monks—and then “codify” these ideas, connect those 
bits of knowledge, and construct unique new models for understanding the 
world. This is my gift.
In the world of computers, you might call this being a hacker. To hack, 
in that world, is to cut something apart, break it to the core, and then reas-
semble it to make it better than before.
That’s what I do. I was trained as a computer engineer, but I was born 
with a mind that loved learning how to hack life. I see patterns that others 
sometimes miss and connect dots in very unusual ways.
In this book, I’m going to share with you some of these dots—10, in 
particular. I’ve collected them through my life experiences and from listen-
ing to brilliant thinkers, leaders, creators, and artists who pursue greatness 
in their everyday lives.
As I learned from these extraordinary people, my life grew exponen -
tially. I became who I am because when I was broke and struggling, I made 
it a point to consistently seek out and listen to people who were just a step 
ahead of me. I’d take in their wisdom, assimilate the lessons, and grow. 
Then I’d level up, make new connections, and learn from people a step 
ahead from that level. And on and on.
Eventually, I got to pose questions to people like Elon Musk, Richard 
Branson, Peter Diamandis, Arianna Huffington, and Ken Wilber. Their 
wisdom is shared in this book along with the distilled wisdom from more 
than 200 hours of interviews with more than 50 extraordinary minds who 
live life by their own rules while making an amazing impact on the planet.

I also founded Mindvalley, which grew to become one of the world’s 
leading companies in human transformation. With more than 2 million 
subscribers, we’ve been at the forefront of much of the new ideas happening 
globally on personal growth. The access to wisdom and minds I get from 
Mindvalley’s network gives me another unique edge in writing this book.
My talent is to take all of these ideas and knowledge and unify them into a 
single path, a path you can follow to break the bounds of the ordinary and to 
take you to all those beautiful places you may have dreamed of going as a kid.
Here’s an overview of what we’ll be exploring.
TEN LAWS FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE
There’s an invisible code as to how the world operates—how human beings 
interact with each other, how we worship, relate with our parents, perform 
at work, fall in love, make money, and stay healthy and happy. I started my 
career as a computer programmer spending hours in front of a screen trying 
to understand the code of machines. Today, I’m more obsessed with the 
code of how the human world operates—and, believe me, this code is just 
as hackable.
Just as a programmer can program a computer to do specific tasks by 
understanding its code, you can program your life and the world around 
you to improve, enhance the way you live and the experiences you have in 
this lifetime.
But first, you have to see this code. And that’s where this book comes in.
This book is divided into four parts and ten chapters. Each part looks at 
a different level of the code and represents an expansion of your state of 
awareness. Each chapter provides and describes a law that takes you fur -
ther into this expansion.
PART I. Living in the Culturescape: How You Were Shaped by the World 
Around You
PART II.  The Awakening: The Power to Choose Your Version of the 
World
PART III. Recoding Yourself: Transforming Your Inner World
PART IV. Becoming Extraordinary : Changing the World

xviii INTROD UC TION
These four parts represent a gradual expansion of your levels of aware -
ness of who you are and just what you’re capable of. The illustration below 
shows these levels as an expanding circle of awareness.
Within these four worlds I’ll be sharing 10 laws, each of which builds on 
the one before. This is the Code of the Extraordinary Mind.
Part I. Living in the Culturescape: How You Were 
Shaped by the World Around You
This section looks at the world we live in with all its messy and conflicting 
ideas, beliefs, and patterns that we’ve invented in an attempt to keep 
humanity safe and under control. The problem is that many of these pat -
terns and rules long moved past their expiration date. In this section, you 
learn to question the rules of the world around you—from your religion to 
your relationships to your career and education. Here we introduce you to 
Laws 1 and 2.
1. TRANSCEND THE CULTURESCAPE. We’ll explore the tangled web of 
the culturescape—humanity’s collective rules, beliefs, and practices about 
life. These are the rules that tell you how to exist, how to plan your life,

how to define success and happiness. Following them is a sure path to being 
ordinary and safe. But I’m going to urge you to instead jump on the thrill -
ing, sometimes uncertain, yet exciting ride of an unrestricted  life. It all 
starts with asking a few disruptive questions.
2. QUESTION THE BRULES. Here you’ll discover how to identify bulls**t 
rules or Brules that should have expired generations ago but that still infect 
our lives. Getting rid of our Brules is like shedding old dirty clothing and 
putting on something fresh. It’s liberating. Extraordinary people tend to 
have an allergy to Brules. You will, too, as we explore how Brules can keep 
us tied up in older ways of living and limit our creativity and growth.
Part II. The Awakening: The Power to Choose 
Your Version of the World
As you learn to question the Brules of the culturescape, you also learn that 
you can choose your own rules. Here we look at the interface between you 
and the world around you. What ideas and values do you choose to believe? 
What do you choose to reject? You’ll learn to consciously mold the beliefs, 
habits, and practices that shape your life while you discard old beliefs and 
systems that you no longer need. The method for doing this is a process I 
call “consciousness engineering.”
3. PRA CTICE CONSCIOUSNESS ENGINEERING. Here’s where you’ll 
learn how to think like a hacker and discover the crucial framework for 
understanding HOW your beliefs and practices shape you. You’ll learn to see 
beliefs as “models of reality” and habits and practices as “systems for living.” 
You’ll cut to the core of who you are and learn to rebuild and remake yourself 
anew through this powerful mental model for growth and awakening.
4. REWRITE YOUR MODELS OF REALITY. These are the beliefs ingrained 
in you since you were a child. Many are disempowering and keep you stuck 
in troublesome, painful, or mediocre ways of viewing the world. Here you’ll 
learn how to swap out disempowering models and replace them with newer, 
more empowering ones. The world reflects your beliefs—so imagine what 
happens when you take on the beliefs of extraordinary minds.
5. UPGRADE YOUR SYSTEMS FOR LIVING. Your systems for living are 
your daily practices for getting on with life, from eating to working to parent-
ing to making love. New systems for living are being discovered all the time.

Most just never make it into our formal education system. So most of us 
learn, love, work, meditate, and parent using models that are suboptimal or 
even damaging. You’ll learn how to observe the systems that run the world 
(and your life) and how to optimize them to be more powerful than ever 
before. You’ll also learn how to curate and install updated systems for liv -
ing to make you a far more optimized human being.
And then we get to the second half the book.
Thus far the book has been about your functioning in the outer world 
and how to first break the rules, and then create new ones that lead to 
greater growth and happiness for yourself. As you get better at this, the 
next step is to explore your inner world. How can you transform the 
world within  you? We’ll be bringing a beautiful order and balance to 
this world.
Part III. Recoding Yourself:  
Transforming Your Inner World
In Part III we explore how to hack consciousness itself, including alternate 
ideas of what it is to be human, to be happy, and to pursue goals that will 
ultimately lead to a fulfilling life. We also explore the idea that conscious -
ness can shape the world you experience—an idea I call “bending reality.”
6. BEND REALITY. This is a model of reality that suggests that there is an 
optimal state of living where everything seems to just click and luck seems to

to exist in this state. Some were monks. Some were billionaires. I’ll dissect 
this state of being and share with you how you, too, can get there.
7. LIVE IN BLISSIPLINE. Happiness is hackable, and Blissipline is a beau -
tiful discipline for leveling up your happiness every day and feeling limit -
less. We’ll explore why happiness can be so elusive, and you’ll discover 
some of the best practices I’ve discovered for hacking happiness and other 
positive emotions.
8. CREATE A VISION FOR YOUR FUTURE. Most of us are trained by the 
Brules of the world to pursue the wrong goals. I think much of modern goal 
setting is absolute rubbish. I’ll show you how to set goals that truly, deeply 
lead to happiness, create meaning, and allow you to live a life that’s exciting 
and purposeful.

Part IV. Becoming Extraordinary:  
Changing the World
In this section you learn how to go from creating your own rules for the 
world and mastery of your inner self to going forth and actually changing 
the world. This is the point when you can truly say you’ve become extraor-
dinary. You’ve not just mastered your inner and outer worlds—you’re using 
this power to push humanity forward and make a positive dent in the uni -
verse. In order to do this, you need two things: to be unfuckwithable and 
to find your quest.
9. BE UNFUCKWITHABLE. Here you learn how to be so rock solid in 
your own self that judgments from others or fear of loss no longer affect 
you. You’re unshakeable in your journey through the world. Changing the 
world is tough. This chapter shows you how to be strong enough to weather 
the storm.
10. EMBRACE YOUR QUEST. And then we come to Chapter 10. Here 
you learn to go beyond just living in the world to actually changing it  by 
discovering your quest. When you find it (and I’ll teach you a method for 
doing so), you take that final step toward living an extraordinary life.
After you finish the 10 chapters that unveil and teach you the code, I did 
not want to keep you hanging as you voyage out into the world. So I’ve 
included two bonus chapters on how to take all the ideas and tools and 
practices in this book and unify them into a daily practice.
Bonus Section: Tools for Your Journey
PRACTICE TRANSCENDENCE. In this section I’ll teach you a 20-minute 
daily practice called the Six-Phase. It’s a workout for the mind that helps 
lock in the elements of the code and accelerate your awakening. It’s one of 
the greatest personal growth and productivity tools I’ve discovered.
FOLLOWING THE CODE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MIND. In this sec-
tion I summarize in one place all the key tools and practices you can bring 
into your life to live the code.
The bonus sections are supported by the Online Experience. You can

e’re all swimming in a massive sea of human beliefs, ideas, 
and practices. Some are beautiful and bring joy; others are 
unnecessary, limiting, and sometimes even crippling. A fish 
is the last to see that it’s swimming in a substance called water. Likewise 
we’re often last to see how this mass of human thoughts—what I call the 
culturescape—completely saturates and influences our lives.
The culturescape sets up rules on how to love, how to eat, how to marry, 
how to get a job. It establishes benchmarks to measure your self-worth. Are 
you good enough if you don’t have a college degree? Do you need to settle 
down and have kids? Embrace a religion? Choose a particular profession?
In this section we dive into the culturescape, where you’ll discover things 
about its absurdity that you might have missed before.
In Chapter 1 you’ll learn how the culturescape has been governing your 
life with a series of “shoulds.” You should be doing this. Y ou should be 
living like that. You’ll see why life is best lived outside the shoulds and how 
there can be beauty in the wilder ride of an unrestricted life.
In Chapter 2 you’ll learn how to detect the outdated rules that hold so

It’s going to be a fun journey—a little controversial in some aspects

When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is

world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have 
a nice family life, have fun, save money. That’s a very limited

4 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
There was so much excitement in the air—we were like young Hogwarts 
students meeting Dumbledore for the first time.
I’d labored toward this goal for years, first working my butt off to get 
good grades in high school so I could gain admission to one of the best 
engineering colleges in the world—the University of Michigan, where I 
studied electrical engineering and computer science. In Malaysia, where 
I’d lived until the age of nineteen, as in other parts of Asia, it was the 
norm for families and educators to promote the idea of growing up to 
become an engineer, lawyer, or doctor. As a kid, I remember being told 
that if you were smart, that’s what you did. It was just kind of how that 
world operated.
Yet the sad truth was that I dreaded my computer engineering classes in 
college. What I really wanted to be was a photographer or a stage actor. 
Photography and performing arts were the only classes where I got As. But 
those were not acceptable careers at all, according to the rules. So, I gave 
them up for programming. After all, I had to be practical and realistic. Get 
good grades. Get a good job. Work the nine-to-five. Save my money for a 
healthy retirement. Do it right and I would be a “success.”
And I was beginning to succeed. It felt amazing to be honored with this 
opportunity to be in Bill’s home and to be working at this company, then in 
its heyday. My professors were elated for me. My parents were thrilled. It 
made the hours of study and my parents’ sacrifices worthwhile. I’d done 
everything that had been asked of me. Now it was time to reap the rewards. 
I had arrived. And I was standing in the home of Bill frickin’ Gates with my 
career laid out before me.
But deep inside, I knew I had a problem.
On that fateful day in the summer of 1998, I had simultaneously accom-
plished two things: first, the completion of a long, many-year journey, and 
second, the painful realization that I had been walking in the wrong direc -
tion the entire damn time.
See, I genuinely disliked my job. I’d sit in my private office at Microsoft 
headquarters, staring at my triple-screen monitor, and count the minutes 
until I could escape. I disliked the work so much that, even though Bill 
Gates was standing just a few feet away from me surrounded by my col -
leagues, I felt too ashamed to shake his hand. I felt I shouldn’t be there.
So a few weeks later, I quit.

Okay, I got fired.
I was too chicken to take charge and quit. To study at a top computer 
engineering college, get the coveted interview, and then snag the even-more-
coveted job at the company my fellow students were dying to get into—to 
get that far and then quit was going to disappoint a lot of people.
So I did the next best thing a spineless twenty-two-year-old could do. I 
deliberately got myself fired. I simply goofed off and got caught playing 
video games at my desk way too many times during office hours until my 
manager was forced to fire me. So, as they say, that happened.
I went back to college and limped to the finish line. I had no idea what 
I was going do after graduation and felt almost stupid for blowing my huge 
opportunity with Microsoft.
As it turns out, getting out of there was the smart thing to do. I wasn’t 
just quitting a job (and a career path)—I had also decided to quit following 
the socially approved rules for how life is supposed to work.
LET’S ADMIT IT’S NOT WORKING
When I went my own way rather than choosing the path of the practical 
and realistic job, it wasn’t because I thought there was anything wrong with 
being a computer engineer. But I did—and still do—think there’s some -
thing wrong with the idea that we should work at something we have no 
passion for, just because it’s the norm or the rule in the world we’re born 
into.
Yet many of us do just that. According to a Gallup study surveying more 
than 150,000 Americans, 70 percent of respondents said they were “disen -
gaged” from their jobs. Given the amount of time we spend at work, a job 
we have no passion for puts us at risk of living a life we have no passion for. 
But it’s not just our ideas about careers that are faulty. Consider these addi-
tional stats:
 ■ 40 to 50 percent of US marriages end in divorce.
 ■ A Harris poll showed that only 33 percent of Americans polled 
claimed to be “very happy.”
 ■ According to CNBC, “a new report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, 
which examined debt through the generations  . . . found that eight in

ten Americans are in debt in some fashion, most often because of a 
mortgage.”
 ■ According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more 
than one-third of adults in the United States are now obese.
Thus, our careers, our love lives, our happiness, our financial standing, 
and our health are all in conditions that are pretty inadequate. How did we 
get here, and how do we escape?
There are many reasons why these things happen. But I submit to you 
that one big reason is the tyranny of rules—rules that suggest we “should” 
do life in a particular way because everyone else seems to be doing it, too:
I should take this job.
I should date/marry this type of person.
I should go to this college.
I should major in this subject.
I should live in this city.
This is how I should look.
This is how I should feel.
Don’t get me wrong. People sometimes have to take jobs they dislike in 
order to make ends meet. They have to live in places they wouldn’t choose 
because it’s all they can afford at the time or because they have family 
responsibilities.
But there’s a big difference between bending to life’s necessities and 
blindly accepting that you must live your life according to preconceived 
rules. One of the keys to being extraordinary is knowing what rules to fol -
low and what rules to break. Outside the rules of physics and the rules of 
law, all other rules are open to questioning.
To understand this, we first have to understand why these rules exist in 
the first place.
THE DAWN OF THE RULES
Who made up the rules of the modern world anyway? To try to answer that 
question, let’s take a quick leap into the beginnings of human history.

In his fascinating book Sapiens, historian Yuval Noah Harari, PhD, puts 
forward the idea that at a certain point in history, there could have been as 
many as six different types of humans living on the planet at once. There 
was Homo sapiens,  which is what we all are. But there were also Homo 
neanderthalensis,  Homo soloensis, and Homo erectus, among others.
But over time, all of the nonsapiens, such as the Neanderthals, died out, 
leaving Homo sapiens as our prehistoric grandmother or grandfather.
What helped sapiens survive?
The reason for our ultimate dominance, according to Dr. Harari, was our 
use of language—and specifically, its complexity in comparison to others’. 
Primatologists who have studied monkeys have found that monkeys can alert 
others in their group to danger, along the lines of, say, “Look out—tiger!”
But our sapiens forebears had very different brains. In contrast, sapiens 
could say, in effect, “Hey, this morning I saw a tiger by the river, so let’s chill 
here until the tiger leaves to hunt, and then we can go there to eat, okay?”
Our sapiens ancestors had the ability to communicate complex informa-
tion important to survival through the effective use of language. Language 
allowed us to organize groups of people—to share news of dangers or oppor-
tunities. To create and teach practices and habits: to communicate not just 
where the berries were on the riverbank but also how to pick, cook, and pre-
serve them, what to do if someone ate too many, and even who should have 
the first and biggest helping. Language allowed us to preserve knowledge by 
passing it from person to person, parent to child, generation to generation.
It’s difficult to overstate the power successive generations gained from 
literally not having to reinvent the wheel. Language gave rise to beautiful 
complexity on every level.
But the biggest advantage of language is that it allowed us to create a 
whole new world within our heads. We could use it to create things that 
didn’t exist in the physical world but simply as “understandings” in our 
heads: to form alliances, establish tribes, and develop guidelines for coop -
eration within and between larger and larger groups. It allowed us to form 
cultures, mythologies, and religions. On the flip side, though, it also 
allowed us to go to war over those cultures, mythologies, and religions.
These changes and more, driven by advances in our thinking and 
enhanced by our ability to use language to share what we knew, were truly 
revolutionary—indeed, taken together, Dr. Harari calls this the cognitive  
revolution.

8 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
CAN YOU SEE SOMETHING IF YOU DON’T 
HAVE A WORD FOR IT?
If you don’t believe how pervasively language shaped us and our world, 
here’s some intriguing research pointing to its power.
Did the color blue exist in ancient cultures? According to a Radiolab 
podcast entitled “Why Isn’t the Sky Blue?” in ancient times there was no 
word for blue in numerous languages. Homer, in The Odyssey, didn’t men-
tion the color blue for the sky or for the Aegean Sea, which he called wine-
dark. Nor did the word blue appear in other ancient writings otherwise rich 
with description and visual detail.
So the question arises: If there’s no word for a thing, can you see it?
Researcher Jules Davidoff studied this question among a particular tribe 
called the Himba, in Namibia. The Himba have many different words for 
green but no word for blue.
As part of the research, the tribe members were shown a circular pattern 
of squares. All of the squares were green except for one that was obviously 
blue like in the image below:
Oddly, when tribe members were shown the image and were asked to 
point to the outlier, they either couldn’t select the blue square as the differ-
ent one, were slower to do so, or chose the wrong square.
But when shown a similar circular pattern of green squares with one 
square a subtly different (and to many of us difficult to discern) shade of 
green, they quickly found it.

 TRA N SC END  THE CUL TURE SC APE  9
What would be easy for us was not easy for them. What would be diffi-
cult for us was easy for them. The Himba had no word for blue and thus 
could not easily identify a blue square from a collection of green squares—a 
task simple enough for most of us. Yet they could discern shades of green 
we would never notice.
So it seems that what language delineates, we can more easily discern. 
Our language shapes what we “see.”
THE DUAL WORLDS WE LIVE IN
How miraculous was this ability language gave us to step back and observe 
our lives—to scope out that riverbank, assess risk and opportunity, and 
then seek not only advantage for ourselves but also go back to our tribe and 
share our thoughts with others. Together we became more aware, better 
able to plan for and prevail over challenges, and capable of inventing solu -
tions to problems and then being able to teach those solutions to others. 
Language became the building blocks to culture.
These guidelines for living, developed and passed on through language, 
eventually evolved into the rules that govern our cultures. Our cultures 
helped us make sense of our world, process events quickly, create religions 
and nation-states, train our children so they’d be more likely to thrive, and 
open up mental and physical bandwidth to do more with our big brains 
than just try to survive until tomorrow.
Of course, there’s a darker side to culture: when we get so focused on our 
rules that we turn them into decrees about how life “should” be and label peo-
ple or processes as good or bad if they don’t follow the rules. This is how you 
should live. This is how you should dress. This is how women, children, the 
sick, the elderly, or the “different” should be treated. My tribe is superior to 
your tribe. My ways are right, which means that yours are wrong. My beliefs 
are right, and yours are wrong. My God is the only God. We create these com-
plex worlds and then literally defend them with our lives. The language and 
rules that define our culture can cost lives as much as cultivate them.
WELCOME TO THE CULTURESCAPE
With this vast structure of beliefs and practices that we developed for nav -
igating the world, we actually created a new world layered on top of the one

10 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
we lived every day on the proverbial riverbank. We’ve been living in two 
worlds ever since.
There’s the physical world of absolute truth. This world contains things 
we’re all likely to agree on: This is the riverbank; rocks are hard; water is 
wet; fire is hot; tigers have big teeth and it hurts when they bite you. No 
arguments there.
But there’s also the world of relative truth. It’s the mental world of ideas, 
constructs, concepts, models, myths, patterns, and rules that we’ve devel -
oped and passed from generation to generation—sometimes for thousands 
of years. This is where concepts such as marriage, money, religion, and laws 
reside. This is relative truth because these ideas are true only for a particu -
lar culture or tribe. Socialism, democracy, your religion, ideas about educa-
tion, love, marriage, career, and every other “should” are nothing more 
than relative truths. They are simply not true for ALL human beings.
I call this world of relative truth the culturescape.
From the moment we’re born, we’re swimming in the culturescape. Our 
beliefs about the world and our systems for functioning in the world are all 
embedded in us through the flow and progression of culture from the minds of 
the people around us into our baby brains. But there’s just one problem. Many 
of these beliefs and systems are dysfunctional, and while the intention is that 
these ideas should guide us, in reality they keep us locked into lives far more 
limited than what we’re truly capable of. A fish is the last to discover water 
because it’s been swimming in it all its life. Similarly, few people discover how 
pervasive and powerful the secondary world of our culturescape really is. We 
are not as independent and freethinking as we’d like to think we are.
The world of absolute truth is fact-based. The world of the 
culturescape is opinion-based and agreement-based. Yet even 
though it exists solely in our heads, it is very, very real.
How can a world that exists in our heads be real? Consider these exam-
ples of mental constructs we have created that do not exist in the physical 
world—but that are very real to us:
 ■ We can’t draw a calorie or point to one, but we believe that eating too 
many will give us love handles.
 ■ We can’t touch or see meditation, but more than 1,400 scientific studies

show that it influences body and mind in positive ways, from improving 
longevity to enhancing creativity.
 ■ You and I may not agree on how to define God, but God exists in differ-
ent and unique ways to many people and much of human society is based 
on it. Even if one takes the view that God is imaginary, it remains a 
powerful syntax in the brain that influences how billions live their lives.
 ■ Corporations  don’t actually exist in the physical world—you fill out 
forms and get a piece of paper declaring the formation of the entity. 
But that piece of paper establishes a series of laws and constructs that 
allow a group of people to come together and build something they 
couldn’t have built on their own.
 ■ We can’t see or touch laws—they’re just agreements among groups 
clustered in communities called cities, states,  and countries. But they 
allow enormous groups of people to live in relative harmony.
 ■ There’s a widespread construct called marriage in which two people 
are expected to commit to each other for the rest of their lives, and yet 
every culture has different ideas of what that commitment should 
mean—physically, emotionally, and financially.
 ■ In many cultures, there’s a construct called retirement in which people 
are expected to alter their activities dramatically after a certain age.
 ■ There are no actual borders drawn on the Earth, and the subjectivity 
of borders becomes painfully obvious when we summarily redraw 
them, as often happens at treaty time. Yet billions of people belong to 
border-defined places called nations.
In this way our thoughts literally do construct our world. We create and 
receive these constructs. We transmit them from generation to generation. 
They can be incredibly empowering or completely restrictive. For the con -
venience of being able to operate mindlessly in a complex world, we accept 
many of these culturescape constructs as true. The problem is—much of 
them are long past their expiration dates.
STEPPING OUT OF THE CULTURESCAPE
If so much of what we call life is mostly created by our thoughts and beliefs, 
then much of what we take to be real—all the constructs, rules, and

12 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
“shoulds” of the culturescape—is nothing more than an accidental tweak 
of history. For the most part there’s no rational basis to prove that what 
we’re doing is the right way or the only way to do things. Much of what you 
think is true is all in your head.
How’d it get there? As Steve Jobs said, it was “made up by people no 
smarter than you.” Once you understand that the rules aren’t absolute, you 
can learn to think outside the box and live beyond limits imposed by the 
culturescape.
Realizing that the world you’re living in exists inside your head puts you 
in the driver’s seat. You can use your own mind to deconstruct the beliefs, 
systems, and rules you’ve been living with. The rules are very real in the 
sense that they actually govern how people and societies act, but very real 
does not mean very right.
The culturescape is so strong, so self-reinforcing that it convinces us that 
life must unfold in a particular way. This is fine if you’d like to live a regu-
lar, safe life. There’s nothing wrong with that. The problem happens when 
“safety” gives rise to boredom and eventually stagnation.
We start our lives strong; as children we learn, grow, and change at an 
exhilarating pace. Yet for most people, once they graduate from college and 
start their careers, that growth slows down and eventually leads to a creep-
ing, boring stagnation. If you were to draw this as a graph, it would look 
something like this:
Quality

Stagnation

But what if we changed the definition of life from the drawing above to 
the drawing below:
Notice the shift from slow, steady growth to irregular, up-and-down 
growth. Different, right? What if life was not meant to be safe? Instead, 
what if it was meant to be a beautiful joyride, with ups and downs as we 
take off the training wheels of the culturescape and try out things outside 
what is practical or realistic?
What if we accepted that things will go wrong—but that this is simply 
part of life’s beautiful unfolding and that even the biggest failures can have 
within them the seeds of growth and possibility?
Our culturescape evolved to keep us safe—but in this day and age, we 
no longer need to fear tigers by the riverbank. Safety is overrated; taking 
risks is much less likely to kill us than ever before, and that means that 
playing it safe is more likely just holding us back from the thrills of a life 
filled with meaning and discovery.
Give me the thrill and excitement of the unsafe, rule-
breaking, dogma-questioning life anytime over the boring 
unfolding of a safe life.

questioned the meaning of careers, degrees, religions, ways of living, and 
other “be safe” rules. In many cases, their willingness to break away from 
the culturescape has resulted in innovations and new beginnings that will 
shift the future of humanity. One such person is Elon Musk.
In 2013 I got to visit the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, Califor -
nia, where I met the legendary Elon Musk. Elon is a living icon—a man 
who is changing the course of human history with innovations to electric 
cars via Tesla Motors, solar energy via Solar City, transportation via his 
Hyperloop idea, and space travel via SpaceX. He is arguably the greatest 
entrepreneur on the planet today.
I had a simple question to ask Elon. Being in the presence of a living leg-
end made me a little nervous, so my question came out awkwardly: “Elon, 
you’ve done some pretty epic things, stuff most people would never even 
dream about. Yet what makes Elon Musk? I mean, if we could put you in a 
blender and blend you to distill your essence, what would that essence be?”
Elon laughed at the oddness of my question and the idea of being 
“blended,” but then shared the following story:
“When I was just starting out, I walked into Netscape to get a job. I just 
sat in the lobby holding my résumé, waiting quietly for someone to talk to 
me. No one did. I waited and waited.”
Elon mentioned that he had no idea what protocol to follow. He just 
waited, hoping someone would come and invite him for an interview.
“But no one spoke to me,” he said.
“So I said: ‘Fuck it! I’ll just start my own company.’”
The world was forever changed that day.
Elon went on to start a little classified ad company in 1995 that was 
called Zip2 with $28,000. He sold it in 1999 and pocketed $22 million. He 
then used the windfall to start a company to challenge the rules of commer-
cial online banking—which evolved into PayPal. But he didn’t stop there.
In 2002 he started SpaceX to build a better rocket. And in 2008 he 
assumed the leadership of Tesla Motors to help make electric cars 
mainstream.
From banking to space exploration to electric cars, Elon challenged 
rules that few others dared question and in the process is leaving the planet 
with a legacy that is jaw-droppingly huge.
Elon shared a lot more, too. And we’ll explore those other nuggets of 
wisdom in later chapters.

But first, let me introduce Law 1.
WHY SAFETY IS OVERRATED
The culturescape is designed to keep us safe. But as I’ve mentioned, safety 
is often overrated. Elon Musk answered my question, he spoke at length 
about his journey and what drove him—but he ended with one memorable 
line: “I have a high tolerance for pain.”
Elon bounced back from amazing dips as he built his companies. He 
spoke about how, in 2008, SpaceX’s first three rockets had blown up. A 
fourth failure would have made the company go bust. At the same time, 
Tesla Motors had failed a financing round and was running out of cash. 
Elon had to use up most of his windfall from the PayPal sale to finance these 
companies, and he had to borrow money to pay rent. Yet he came through.
While breaking away from the rules of the culturescape may indeed feel 
scary, I’ve often noticed a repeated pattern. The dips contain amazing 
learnings and wisdom that lead to sharper rises in the quality of life after -
ward. But you will need to brave the momentary pain of these dips. I assure 
you it will be worthwhile, and in this book you’ll learn how to have the 
power to weather those downturns.
Every crappy experience I’ve had—from having my heart broken, to 
almost having to leave my own company due to a conflict with a business 
partner, to depression and staring down gaping dark holes of the mind—led 
to some small-but-significant insight or awakening that boosted the quality 
of my life and made me stronger. I now welcome these dips with an inner 
delight: Wow, this sucks! I can’t wait to see what I’m going to learn here!
One of these dips, of course, was my Microsoft mishap, followed by my 
mediocre graduation. With no other job prospects after losing my Microsoft 
opportunity, I moved to New York City and went to work at a nonprofit at 
Law 1: Transcend the culturescape.
Extraordinary minds are good at seeing the culturescape and are able to 
selectively choose the rules and conditions to follow versus those to ques -
tion or ignore. Therefore, they tend to take the path less traveled and inno -
vate on the idea of what it means to truly live.

a salary level officially below the poverty line. My family and friends 
thought I was crazy.
Earning a salary officially below the poverty line meant that I could not 
afford my own apartment. At Microsoft I had a killer apartment with my own 
bedroom. In New York City I shared a studio in Chelsea with a coworker 
named James—a dirty little apartment with furniture that the previous 
tenants had salvaged from the street. Our sofa and mattresses were covered 
with black marks that could have been soot, mold, or worse. I dared not 
imagine what. But I do vividly remember one night in May 2000.
I had convinced the hot redhead from Estonia whom I had met on a 
work-related trip to Europe to come to New York to visit me. The only 
problem was that she was going to be staying with me in my awful Chelsea 
apartment—something I was deeply embarrassed about. Kristina arrived at 
my apartment and was so thrilled to be in New York that she immediately 
hopped onto James’s bed and started jumping up and down in the excite -
ment of finally visiting New York.
“Um, that’s my roommate’s bed,” I said. “Mine is over there.”
“You have a roommate? So you don’t live here by yourself? But how do 
we . . . you know . . . have some privacy?” she asked, shocked and a little 
bewildered.
I pointed to the inspired solution I had rigged up so we could have pri -
vacy: a pink shower curtain that, with a few pulls, created a mock “wall” 
separating my little nook in the studio from the rest of the shared space with 
James. (Yes, I was too broke to afford real curtains.) It was plastic and ugly—
but it offered just enough privacy to, um, make our nights memorable.
I seriously don’t know what Kristina saw in me, but three years later we 
got married. Today we have two beautiful kids and a home with really nice 
curtains.
I would never have met my wife if I had not quit Microsoft, lost all my 
other job options, and ended up broke in New York—a series of unfortunate 
dips lined up one by one by one that resulted in one sharp, booming spike: 
meeting the woman I would marry and having the children I have today.
See, there is beauty in the dips. We try to avoid them by sticking to the 
passed-down rules of the culturescape, only to wake up one day wondering 
how we missed out on so much. Don’t let that be you. Life has a way of

taking care of you no matter how dark it can sometimes feel—I promise. 
There’s more to it, of course. You need to learn how to change the rules 
(Chapter 2), how to heal your mind (Chapter 3), how to remove dangerous 
beliefs (Chapter 4), how learn new things incredibly fast (Chapter 5), how 
to be lucky (Chapter 6), how to find happiness (Chapter 7), how to know 
what to seek (Chapter 8). And then there’s weathering the inevitable storm 
(Chapter 9), finding your calling (Chapter 10), and lots, lots more. But 
when we set forth on this path, anyone can become truly extraordinary.
I love this quote by American football player and actor Terry Crews: “I 
constantly get out of my comfort zone. Once you push yourself into some -
thing new, a whole new world of opportunities opens up. But you might get 
hurt. But amazingly when you heal—you are somewhere you’ve never been.”
You can be 12 or 80—it’s never too late to question the rules and step 
out of your comfort zone.
WHAT’S NEXT
In the coming chapters, I’ll help you examine the beliefs and systems of your 
life and decide which ones are moving you forward and which are holding you 
back. I’ll provide keys for unlocking your potential to become extraordinary. 
This means shaking off the shackles from cultural baggage of the past, expand-
ing your vision of your future, and experiencing a dramatic shift in how you 
view life, function in the world, pursue goals, and interact with others.
Together, let’s seek a level of advanced awareness in which we can see 
our patterns and go beyond them and understand that, while we may belong 
to a particular culture or nation or religion, we’re only part of that culture 
or nation or religion because we happen to be born in a particular family 
at a particular time and place, and that the same is true of every other 
human being on the Earth. Our individual experiences of the culturescape 
made us who we are. But what happens when we learn to transcend the 
culturescape? When we learn that no one is better off than another? That 
none of us is more superior? And that each of us can be extraordinary?
A SERIOUS WORD OF WARNING
Before we continue, I must issue a word of warning. Questioning many 
rules of the culturescape will not be easy. Here’s a partial list of all the

things that could go “wrong” if you continue reading this book:
 ■ You might anger loved ones as you decide to question their expecta -
tions of you.
 ■ You might decide to leave your current relationship.
 ■ You might decide to raise your kids with different beliefs.
 ■ You might choose to question your religion or create your own cus -
tomized religious system.
 ■ You might rethink your career.
 ■ You might become obsessed with being happy.
 ■ You might decide to forgive someone who hurt you in the past.
 ■ You might rip apart your current goal sheet and start anew.
 ■ You might start a daily spiritual practice.
 ■ You might fall out of love with someone and fall in love with yourself.
 ■ You might decide to leave your career and start a business.
 ■ You might decide to leave your business and start a career.
 ■ You might find a mission that excites you a lot and scares you a little.
It all starts with questioning the accepted rules of the culturescape. My 
friend Peter Diamandis, founder and chairman of the X Prize Foundation, 
famously said:
If you can’t win, change the rules. If you can’t change the 
rules, ignore them.
I love this advice. But before you can challenge the rules of the culture -
scape, you have to identify the limiting rules that might be holding you 
back. It starts with discovering the ones you’re locked into and operating 
under right now (whether you know it or not).
Maybe you won’t be surprised to know that the process starts with lan-
guage—with a new word, to be precise—for what language delineates, we 
can more easily discern.
The new word is Brule.

Where We Learn That Much of How the World 
Runs Is Based on Bulls**t Rules Passed Down 
from Generation to Generation
You will find that many of the truths we cling to depend 
greatly on our own point of view.
Who’s more foolish, the fool? Or the fool who follows him?
—SAYING S OF OBI-WAN KENOBI, STAR WARS
THE LIES WE CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
In Chapter 1, we looked at how human beings simultaneously exist in two 
worlds. There’s the physical world of absolute truth and the culturescape of 
relative truth. In the culturescape all the ideas we hold dear—our identity, 
our religion, our nationality, our beliefs about the world—are nothing more 
than mental constructs we’ve chosen to believe. And like all mental con -
structs, many are merely opinions we believe because they were drilled into 
us as children and accepted by the culture we grew up in.
Human beings are far less rational than we think. Many ideas we hold 
dear and cling to as “truth” fall apart under close inspection. Our mental 
constructs of the world can change, pivot, expand, and shrink as human 
cultures, ideologies, and opinions collide, dance, and clash with each other. 
Just as disease is spread by contagion from host to victim, so ideas are 
spread in the same way. We often take on ideas not through rational choice

but through “social contagion”—the act of an idea spreading from mind to 
mind without due questioning.
Thus our so-called “truths” are rarely optimal ways of life. As consumer 
psychologist Paul Marsden, PhD, wrote in a paper called “Memetics and 
Social Contagion: Two Sides of the Same Coin?”:
Whilst we may like to believe that we consciously and rationally 
decide on how to respond to situations, social contagion evidence 
suggests that some of the time this is simply not the case. Rather than 
generating and “having” beliefs, emotions, and behaviours, social 
contagion research suggests that, in some very real sense, those 
beliefs, emotions, and behaviours “have” us. . . . When we are unsure 
of how to react to a stimulus or a situation, these theories suggest 
that we actively look to others for guidance and consciously imitate 
them.
It’s a stunning statement. Dr. Marsden is saying that when we make 
decisions, we’re more likely to defer to the hive mind than to make a deci -
sion based entirely on our own thoughts and best interests. We don’t have 
beliefs so much as beliefs “have” us .
Dr. Marsden continues:
The evidence shows that we inherit and transmit behaviours, 
emotions, beliefs, and religions not through rational choice but 
contagion.
This is perhaps one of the most important lines in Dr. Marsden’s paper. 
We think we’re making a rational decision. But often, the decision has little 
to do with rationality and more to do with ideas our family, culture, and 
peers have approved.
There’s nothing wrong with taking on ideas from the society we live in. 
But as our world is undergoing exponential change at a staggering pace, 
following the masses and doing what’s always been done isn’t a path that 
leads to being extraordinary. Ideas, memes, and culture are meant to evolve 
and change, and we are best served when we question them.

We know intellectually that this sort of change happens, yet billions of 
us cling to self-defeating rules from the past that should not exist in today’s 
world because technology, society, and human consciousness have simply 
evolved beyond them.
In Chapter 1, you learned about the Himba tribe and their difficulty 
with seeing the color blue because they have no word for it. Words play an 
important role in cognition. So I coined a name for these outdated rules so 
we can see them better: The word I use is “Brules.”
We use Brules to categorize things, processes, and even people. Brules 
are handed down by our tribe—often our family, culture, and educational 
system. For example, do you remember choosing your religion? Or how you 
got your ideas about love, money, or the way life works? Most of us don’t. 
Many of our most formative rules about how to live come through others. 
And these rules are tightly bound to ideas of what is good and bad, right 
and wrong.
Each of us lives by thousands of rules. When we aren’t sure what to do, we 
follow the example of those who came before us. Kids follow their parents, 
who followed their parents, who followed theirs, and so on back in time.
This means that often we are not Christian or Jewish or politically right 
or left because we decided we wanted to be, but simply because we hap -
pened to be born in a particular family at a particular time and, through 
memetics and social conditioning, adopted a particular set of beliefs. We 
may decide to take a certain job (as happened to me when I became a com-
puter engineer), go to law school, get an MBA, or join the family business, 
not because we made a rational decision that this was the path we wanted 
to follow but because society programmed us that we should.
You can see from an evolutionary standpoint how it would be efficient 
to mimic the patterns modeled by those who came before. Ideas such as 
Brule: A Definition
A Brule is a bulls**t rule that we adopt to simplify our understanding  
of the world.

how to harvest, hunt, cook, and communicate get passed down from gen -
eration to generation, allowing civilization to steadily grow in complexity 
and scale. But it means we may be living our lives according to models that 
haven’t been upgraded for years, decades, even centuries. Blindly following 
may be efficient, but it’s not always smart.
When we look at them closely, we often find that Brules were imposed 
on us for convenience. To question and dissect these Brules is to take a step 
into the extraordinary.
My life of questioning the Brules started at age nine. That’s when a 
McDonald’s opened close to my home. Everywhere I turned, it seemed, 
there were ads showing mouthwatering pictures of McDonald’s cheeseburg-
ers. Man, they looked good. And I so so so craved a Happy Meal. But I had 
been brought up as a Hindu and therefore had been told that I could abso -
lutely, positively not eat beef. Ever.
McDonald’s had created a phenomenon of manufactured demand. I had 
never tasted beef, but thanks to all those ads and images of people “lovin’ 
it,” I concluded that McDonald’s burgers were going to be the greatest meal 
I’d ever tasted in my nine years on planet Earth. The only thing stopping me 
was that, culturally, I wasn’t supposed to eat beef, since it would anger the 
gods (or something similarly dreadful).
My parents had always encouraged me to question things, so I felt com-
fortable asking my mom to explain to me why I couldn’t eat beef. She 
replied that it was part of our family’s culture and religion. “But other 
people eat beef. Why can’t Hindus eat it, too?” I persisted.
Wise teacher that she was, she said, “Why don’t you go find out?” There 
was no Internet back then, but I pored over my Encyclopedia  Britannica  
and developed a theory about ancient India, Hindus, cows, and beef eating 
that I took back to my mother. Basically, it went like this: “Mom, I think 
the ancient Hindus loved having cows as pets because they were gentle and 
had big, beautiful eyes. Cows were also very useful: They could plow the 
fields and provide milk. So maybe that was why Hindus back then wouldn’t 
eat beef when they could so easily eat goat, pig, or any other less awesome 
animal. But last I checked, we have a dog and not a cow, and so I think I 
should be allowed to eat beef burgers.”
I don’t know what was going on in my mom’s head, but she agreed, and 
that’s how I got to taste my first beef burger. Frankly, it was overrated. But

still—boom! Just like that, a dogmatic model of reality I’d grown up blindly 
following was shattered.
I started questioning everything else. By nineteen, I had discarded 
 religion—not because I wasn’t spiritual but because I felt that calling myself 
a Hindu was separating myself from the billions of spiritual people who 
weren’t Hindu. I wanted to embrace the spiritual essence of every religion, 
not just one. Even as a teen, I could not understand the whole idea of being 
bound to one singular religion for life.
I was fortunate to have parents who challenged me and allowed me to 
create my own beliefs. But if a nine-year-old can bust a Brule, the rest of us 
should be able to question them, too.
Take a moment and think about the religious or cultural norms that 
were transmitted to you. How many would you say are truly rational? They 
may be outmoded or proven untrue by today’s thinkers or researchers. 
Many might even cause terrible pain. I’m not advocating that you instantly 
reject all the rules you’ve ever followed, but you must question your rules 
constantly in order to live by the code that is most authentic to your goals 
and needs. “My family/culture/people have always done it this way” is not 
an acceptable argument.
COMMON BRULES WORTH CHALLENGING
As you get on the path to the extraordinary, you must remember that within 
the culturescape there are no sacred cows that cannot be questioned. Our 
politics, our education and work models, our traditions and culture, and 
even our religions all contain Brules that are best discarded.
Below are some common Brules we live by, often without even realizing 
it, and some different ways I’ve come to think about them. They’re among 
the biggest Brules I challenged. Escaping them shifted my life forward in 
dramatic ways. These are the four areas in which I decided to eliminate a 
Brule from my worldview:
1. The college Brule
2. The loyalty to our culture Brule
3. The religion Brule
4. The hard work Brule

24 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
As you read this, ask yourself if you might be held back by any of these 
Brules.
1. We should get a college degree to  
guarantee our success.
In addition to saddling many young people with massive debt for decades, 
studies have shown that a college education really doesn’t guarantee success. 
And does a college degree guarantee high performance on the job? Not 
necessarily. Times are changing fast. While Internet giant Google looks at 
good grades in specific technical skills for positions requiring them, a 2014 
New York Times article detailing an interview with Laszlo Bock, Google’s 
senior vice president of people operations, notes that college degrees aren’t 
as important as they once were. Bock states that “When you look at people 
who don’t go to school and make their way in the world, those are excep -
tional human beings. And we should do everything we can to find those 
people.” He noted in a 2013 New York Times article that the “proportion 
of people without any college education at Google has increased over 
time”—on certain teams comprising as much as 14 percent.
Other companies are taking note. According to a 2015 article in iSchool-
Guide, Ernst and Young, “the largest recruiter in the United Kingdom and 
one of the world’s largest financial consultancies, recently announced that 
they will no longer consider grades as the main criteria for recruitment.” 
The article quoted Maggie Stilwell, Ernst and Young’s Managing Partner 
for Talent: “Academic qualifications will still be taken into account and 
indeed remain an important consideration when assessing candidates as a 
whole, but will no longer act as a barrier to getting a foot in the door.”
I’ve personally interviewed and hired more than 1,000 people for my 
companies over the years, and I’ve simply stopped looking at college grades 
or even at the college an applicant graduated from. I’ve simply found them 
to have no correlation with an employee’s success.
College degrees as a path to a successful career may thus be nothing 
more than a mass societal Brule that’s fading away quickly. This is not to 
say that going to college is unnecessary—my life at college was one of the 
best memories and growth experiences I’ve ever had. But little of that had 
to do with my actual degree or what I was studying.

2. We should marry within our religion or ethnicity.
I come from a very small minority ethnicity from western India. My culture 
is called Sindhi. The Sindhis left India after 1947 and are living as a dias -
pora; that is, scattered all over the world. Like many cultures that live as a 
diaspora, there’s a firm desire to protect and preserve the culture and the 
tradition. As part of that, in my culture, it is considered absolutely taboo to 
marry anyone outside our ethnicity—not even another Indian. So you can 
imagine how shocked my family was when I told them I wanted to marry 
my then-girlfriend, Kristina (now my wife), who is Estonian. I remember 
well-meaning relatives asking me, “Do you really want to do this?  . . . 
Your children are going to be so confused!  . . . Why would you disappoint 
your family like this?”
At first I feared following my heart because I felt I would cause great 
disappointment for those I loved. But I realized that with a huge life deci -
sion such as this, I shouldn’t do something to make someone else happy that 
would make me so unhappy. I wanted to be with Kristina. So I married her. 
I rejected the Brule, so common in my generation, that we should marry 
only people of our ethnicity, religion, and race as it was the safest way to 
happiness and the “right” thing to do for the family or creed. Kristina and 
I have been together for sixteen years, married for thirteen. Our two kids, 
far from being “confused,” are learning multiple languages and happily 
becoming citizens of the world (my son, Hayden, had traveled to eighteen 
countries by the time he was eighteen months old). My children participate 
in Russian Orthodox, Lutheran, and Hindu traditions with their grandpar-
ents. But they aren’t limited to any one religion. They get to experience all 
the beauty of human religions without being locked into any one path. 
Which brings us to the next big Brule.
3. We should adhere to a single religion.
Okay, here’s a touchy question. Do we really need religion? Can spirituality 
exist without religious dogma? These are only a few of the questions being 
asked about religion today. Right alongside a rise in fundamentalism, we’re 
seeing a rise in questioning of the fundamentals. Do you remember the day 
you chose your religion? Few people do because few people get to choose

their religion. Generally, it’s a series or cluster of beliefs implanted in our 
minds at a young age, based on our parents’ religious beliefs. And for 
many, the desire to belong to a family or tribe overrides our rational decision- 
making process and gets us to adopt beliefs that may be highly damaging.
While religion can have immense beauty, it can also have immense dogma 
that causes guilt, shame, and fear-based worldviews. Today the majority of 
people on planet Earth who are religious choose a single religion to subscribe 
to. But this percentage is shrinking as more and more people, especially mil-
lennials, are adopting the model “Spiritual But Not Religious.”
I believe that religion was necessary for human evolution, helping us 
develop guidelines for good moral conduct and cooperation within the tribe 
hundreds and thousands of years ago. But today, as humanity is more con-
nected than ever and many of us have access to the various wisdom and 
spiritual traditions of the world, the idea of adhering to a singular religion 
might be obsolete. Furthermore, I believe that the blind acceptance of reli -
gious dogma is holding us back in our spiritual evolution as a species.
The core of a religion may be beautiful spiritual ideas. But wrapped around 
them are usually centuries of outdated Brules that few bother to question.
Can a person be a good Muslim without fasting during Ramadan? A 
good Christian without believing in sin? A good Hindu who eats beef? Is 
religion an aging model that needs to be updated?
A better alternative, in my opinion, is not to subscribe to one religion 
but to pick and choose beliefs from the entire pantheon of global religions 
and spiritual practices.
I was born in a Hindu family, but over the years, I’ve created my own set 
of beliefs derived from the best of every religion and spiritual book I’ve 
been exposed to. We don’t pick one food to eat every day. Why must we 
pick one religion? Why can’t we believe in Jesus’ model of love and kind -
ness, donate 10 percent of our income to charity like a good Muslim, and 
also think that reincarnation is awesome?
There is much beauty in the teachings of Christ, the Sufism of Islam, the 
Kabbalah from Judaism, the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, or the Buddhist 
teachings of the Dalai Lama. Yet humanity has widely decided that religion 
should be absolutist: In short, pick one and stick to it for the rest of your 
life. And worse—pass it on to your children through early indoctrination, 
so they feel they have to stick to one true path for the rest of their lives. 
Then repeat for generations.

Choose a religion if it gives you meaning and satisfaction, but know that 
you don’t have to accept all aspects of your religion to fit in. You can believe 
in Jesus and not believe in hell. You can be Jewish and enjoy a ham sand -
wich. Don’t get trapped in preset, strict definitions of one singular path, 
thinking you must accept all of a particular tribe’s beliefs. Your spirituality 
should be discovered, not inherited.
4. We must work hard to be successful.
This may start as a worthy idea and morph into a tyrannical Brule. Parents 
want to encourage their kids to stick with challenges, work toward goals, 
and not give up. But that can get twisted into a Brule: If you aren’t working 
hard all the time, you’re lazy and won’t be successful.
This Brule also leads to a corollary Brule that work must feel like a slog. 
It can’t be exciting or meaningful and certainly not fun. Yet a Gallup study 
shows that people who work in jobs that provide them with a sense of 
meaning and joy retire much later than those who work in jobs that provide 
no sense of meaning. When you aren’t suffering for your paycheck, you’re 
likely to be more engaged and committed to what you’re doing. And how 
long can you afford to not like what you do given that most of us spend the 
majority of our waking hours at work? As educator and minister Lawrence 
Pearsall Jacks wrote:
A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between 
his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his 
body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is 
which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever 
he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or 
playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.
In my life I’ve always made a conscious choice to work in fields where I 
love what I do so much that it ceases to feel like work. When you love what 
you do, life seems so much more beautiful—in fact, the very idea of “work” 
dissolves. Instead, it feels more like a challenge, a mission, or a game you 
play. I encourage everyone to try to move toward work that feels this way. It 
does not make any sense to spend the majority of our waking hours at work, 
to earn a living, so we can continue living a life where we spend the majority

of our waking hours at work. It’s a human hamster wheel. Therefore, always 
seek work that you love. Any other way of living misses the point of life itself. 
It won’t happen overnight, but it’s doable. As you progress through this book, 
I’ll share some mental models and practices to get you there faster.
FIVE WAYS WE TAKE ON BRULES
How can we spot Brules that limit us and break free? The first step is to 
know how they got installed within you in the first place. There are five ways 
I believe we take on Brules. When you understand these infection mecha -
nisms, you’ll be better able to identify which rules of the culturescape might 
be reasonable to use for planning your life and which ones may be Brules.
1. Childhood Indoctrination
We absorb most beliefs uncritically as children during our extremely long 
maturity period. While other animals mature relatively quickly or can run 
or swim for their lives soon after birth, we human beings are helpless at 
birth and remain highly dependent for years afterward. During this time we 
are, as Sapiens author Yuval Noah Harari describes, like “molten glass”—
highly moldable by the environment and the people around us:
Most mammals emerge from the womb like glazed earthenware 
emerging from a kiln—any attempt at remolding will only scratch or 
break them. Humans emerge from the womb like molten glass from 
a furnace. They can be spun, stretched, and shaped with a surprising 
degree of freedom. This is why today we can educate our children to 
become Christian or Buddhist, capitalist or socialist, warlike or 
peace loving.
Our malleable brains as children make us amazing learners, receptive to 
every experience and primed to take any shape our culture decrees. Think, 
for example, about how a child born in a multicultural home can grow up 
to speak two or three languages fluently. But it also causes us to take on all 
forms of childhood conditioning.
Ever notice how often a child asks why? The typical parent’s response to 
the steady barrage of why, why, why is usually something along the lines of:

“Because I said so.”
“Because that’s the way it is.”
“Because God wanted it this way.”
“Because Dad says you need to do it.”
Statements like these cause children to get trapped in a thicket of Brules 
they may not even realize are open to question. Those children grow up to 
become adults trapped by restrictions and rules that they have taken to be 
“truth.”
Thus we absorb the rules transmitted by culture and act in the world 
based on these beliefs. Much of this conditioning is in place before the age 
of nine, and we may carry many of these beliefs until we die—until or 
unless we learn to challenge them.
As a parent myself, I know how difficult it can be to answer with honesty 
and sincerity every question a child poses. I was in the car with my son in the 
summer of 2014 when Nicki Minaj’s song “Anaconda” came on the radio 
without my noticing. As the key verse rang out about a particular “ana -
conda” who doesn’t “want none unless” it’s “got buns hun,” my seven-year-
old son, Hayden, asked me, “Dad, why does the anaconda only want buns?”
I turned red, as most parents would. And then in an act I know you’re 
going to forgive me for, I did what I think any other dad in my situation 
would do. I lied.
“It’s a song about a snake that only loves bread,” I said.
Hayden bought it. Phew. Later that day, he told me he wanted to write 
a song about a snake with healthier eating habits.
I’ve fielded my share of difficult “why” questions from my kids. I cer -
tainly asked my parents a lot of them. I bet you did, too. And your parents 
probably did their best to answer you. But some of their answers, especially 
phrases such as, “because that’s the way it is,” might sometimes have set up 
Brules you’re still following.
2. Authority Figures
The men and women of our tribe whom we see as authority figures, usually 
people we depend on in some way, are powerful installers of rules. Cer -
tainly that includes our parents but also relatives, caregivers, teachers, 
clergy, and friends. Many may be wise people with our best interests in 
mind who want to impart rules that will serve us well in life—such as the

30 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
Golden Rule about treating others as we would want to be treated. But 
because we give them authority, we’re also vulnerable to those who pass 
down Brules that they either seek to manipulate us with or that they genu -
inely believe themselves, however wrongly.
Authority has proved to have an astonishing, and potentially dangerous, 
hold over us.
During our evolution as a sentient species, we needed leaders and 
authority figures to help us organize and survive. With the advent of liter -
acy and other skills for acquiring, retaining, and sharing information, 
knowledge is now far more evenly distributed and widely available. It’s time 
we stopped behaving like submissive prehistoric tribe members and started 
questioning some of the things our leaders say.
Take for example, fear-based politics. It’s common in the world today 
for politicians to gain support by creating fear of another group. The Jews, 
the Muslims, the Christians, the Mexican immigrants, the refugees, the 
gays are all blamed in one country or another by a politician seeking votes. 
We need to stop buying into this type of misuse of authority.
But of course it’s not just authority figures on the largest scale who dom-
inate us. Interestingly, some people express feeling a sense of freedom after 
their parents die, because they finally feel able to follow their own desires, 
opinions, and goals, free of parental expectations and the pressure to con -
form to rules their parents approved of.
3. The Need to Belong
We have a tendency to take on Brules because we want to fit in. We’re a 
tribal species, evolved to find security and kinship with each other in 
groups. It was safer than going it alone. Thus survival depended on being 
accepted within the tribe. But sometimes in order to be part of a tribe, we 
take on the tribe’s beliefs, irrational as those may be. So in exchange for 
acceptance, we pay a price in individuality and independence. It’s almost a 
cliché, for example, that teenagers struggle to balance individuality with 
succumbing to peer pressure.
Tribe here refers not to any kind of group with a set of beliefs and 
traditions—it can be a religion, a political party, a club, team, and so on. As 
soon as we define ourselves by a particular view, even if it’s something that we

genuinely agree with, we automatically become more likely to start taking on 
other beliefs of the party—even if these beliefs challenge facts and science.
We see this need for belonging at its strongest when looking at the irra -
tional beliefs people take on when they join cults. The desire to be accepted 
causes them to shut down their ability to question, and they accept highly 
illogical, irrational beliefs.
Tim Urban, who runs the amazing blog waitbutwhy.com, calls this 
blind tribalism. Tim writes:
Humans also long for the comfort and safety of certainty, and 
nowhere is conviction more present than in the groupthink of blind 
tribalism. While a scientist’s data-based opinions are only as strong 
as the evidence she has and inherently subject to change, tribal dog -
matism is an exercise in faith, and with no data to be beholden to, 
blind tribe members believe what they believe with certainty.
You can take on the beliefs of your tribe, but you don’t have to take on all 
of their beliefs, especially if their beliefs are unscientific, unhelpful, or untrue.
4. Social Proof
When we take on rules because someone says, in effect, “everyone’s doing 
it,” we’re adopting beliefs through social proof. Think of it as approval by 
proxy: We believe what someone else tells us to save ourselves the effort of 
assessing the truth of it ourselves. If we’re led to think that “everyone” is 
doing it, believing it, or buying it, then we decide maybe we should, too. A 
modern-day example is advertising: Everyone eats this, buys this, wears 
this . . . this is healthy; that is unhealthy  . . . this is what you need in order 
to make people notice you . . . and so on. You’ve seen the ads. The modern 
advertising age has gotten incredibly slick at using social proof to create 
what I call manufactured demand. Nobody really needs that much 
high-fructose corn syrup packaged as Happiness in a Red Can. Nor do we 
need the thousands of other products that exist solely to fill a void that their 
own commercials create. But manufactured demand turns products that are 
unhealthy into must-haves through the effective use of social proof to create 
desire. If everyone’s doing it—it must be legit.

5. Our Internal Insecurities
Suppose you go on a date with someone you’re really attracted to. After the 
date, the person doesn’t call you back. For many of us, our internal insecu-
rities go into overdrive: I didn’t dress well enough . . . maybe I talked too 
much . . . I shouldn’t have told that joke . . . and on and on. Then, without 
actually finding out why the person hasn’t called, we invent a bunch of 
Brules about love, dating, how we should act on dates, and men and women 
in general. But reality may tell a different story. Maybe the person lost his 
phone and didn’t have your number. Maybe she had a really tough week or 
had to deal with a family crisis.
Yet instead of looking at these logical ideas, we start to create “mean -
ing” around the events. The meaning-making machine in our heads is  
constantly creating meaning about the events that we observe in our lives—
particularly when they involve people we are seeking love or attention from.
Have you ever created meaning in your head about someone’s attitude 
or feelings toward you because of something they do? That’s the meaning- 
making machine in action.
You might already be tuning in to how some of the Brules in your life have 
been installed. Can you think of authority figures who had a lot of influence 
over you? Do you have a memory of doing something you disliked just to 
follow the herd? Did you behave according to rules that would help you fit in?
No judgment here. Remember, this is part of how humans learn. It’s 
how all the information of past generations gets provided to us—including 
good stuff like how to make fire, fashion a wheel, tell a knock-knock joke, 
barbecue some meat, perform CPR, and decorate a Christmas tree. It’s not 
all bad; it’s just that many of us need help realizing that it’s not all good, 
either. Some rules aren’t useful anymore or were never true to begin with. 
It’s time to uninstall what isn’t working.
HOW TO MAKE A DENT IN THE UNIVERSE
Our culturescape is filled with many ideas that are powerful because of the 
sheer number of people who believe in them. Think of ideas like nation-states, 
money, transportation, our education system, and more. But every now and

then a rebel comes along and decides that some of these colossal constructs 
are nothing more than Brules. Most of these rebels talk about changing things 
and are labeled idealists at best, or nut jobs at worst, but once in a while, a 
rebel grabs reality by the horns and, slowly yet decisively, shifts things.
The drawing below illustrates this point. The circle is the culturescape. 
The mass of dots in the middle represents most folks. At first a certain per-
son, perhaps you, decides to move away from viewing the world like every-
one else. You get labeled a misfit, a rebel, a troublemaker.
But then you do something original and wild. Perhaps you write a new 
type of children’s book, as J. K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter books. 
Or, like the Beatles, you decide to move away from traditional sounds and 
create an original type of music. Or, like entrepreneur Elon Musk, you 
decide to popularize the electric car. Some misfits will fail. But some will 
succeed, and when they do, they make a dent in a culturescape.
And that’s when the misfit is labeled a visionary.

34 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
One such visionary is Dean Kamen. I got to visit Dean in 2015 and hear 
him tell me one of the most incredible stories of Brule-breaking I’ve ever 
heard.
Dean Kamen is a modern-day Edison. He holds more than 440 patents. 
He revolutionized wheelchair technology with the iBOT mobility device, 
spearheaded development of the leading home dialysis system, and became 
an icon of engineering with his invention of the Segway Human Trans -
porter. He is a recipient of the National Medal of Technology and a mem -
ber of the National Inventors Hall of Fame. With the Segway, Dean 
questioned the Brule of transportation: Could cities be designed without the 
need for cars? But personally, I’m more impressed by Dean’s questioning of 
the Brule of the nation-state. You see, frustrated by government, Dean 
started his own nation. He is, by his own fiat, Lord Dumpling, president of 
North Dumpling Island—a tiny island nation in Long Island Sound that he 
turned into his own country—only the third country in North America 
after the United States and Canada.
Dean Kamen was never one to follow dumb rules. As one of America’s 
greatest inventors, he had a strict anti-bureaucracy attitude. A healthy dis -
regard for senseless rules and the mind of an innovator can be explosive 
when combined. And as he explained to me and a small group of others 
invited to visit him in May 2015, a giant wind turbine sparked it all.
It started out as what you could call a practical joke, but it became 
something much more. As a great proponent of alternative energy, Dean 
wanted to build a wind turbine on North Dumpling Island, his home a few 
miles off the coast of Connecticut, to help power his house. But New York 
bureaucrats (even though it’s close to Connecticut, the island is actually 
part of New York’s jurisdiction) said the proposed turbine was too big, and 
the noise would disturb the neighbors. “It’s an island,” said Dean. “There 
are no neighbors!” The bureaucrats wouldn’t budge. It was a stalemate.
Dean Kamen is not a man who backs down. As he told us, he was seri -
ously bothered that New York State, which was miles away from North 
Dumpling, had the power to tell him how to run his island. So Dean decided 
that he would take no more. Speaking to a friend of his at Harvard who 
was an expert on constitutional law, Dean found a loophole that allowed 
him to secede—not just from New York but from the entire United States. 
And so on April 22, 1988, the  New York Times carried an article: “From 
Long Island Sound, A New Nation Asserts Itself.”

Dean didn’t just create his own island nation. He created North Dumpling’s 
own constitution, anthem, and currency called (what else?) the dumpling.
How’s that for bending the Brules? Few of us grow up thinking about 
starting our own nation. Or currency. Dean, however, is not an ordinary 
person. Perhaps it was that same inquisitive mind that led him to question 
the Brules of transportation and invent the Segway. He had now questioned 
the idea of nationhood itself. But Dean wasn’t done yet.
New York didn’t relent. Its bureaucrats continued sending warning let-
ters to Dean about the wind turbine. Dean simply sent those letters to the 
New York press with a statement: “See how disrespectful New York 
bureaucrats can be—they dare threaten the head of an independent nation-
state.” The warning letters stopped.
A few months later while visiting the White House (Dean has friends 
in high places), Dean jokingly got President George H. W. Bush to sign a 
nonaggression pact with North Dumpling.
As you can imagine, all of this caused tremendous publicity. A local 
morning talk show decided to visit North Dumpling to do a broadcast from 
the island. During the filming, Dean explained, he asked one of the talk 
show hosts if he’d like to convert his US dollars to dumplings. The host 
scoffed, asking if dumplings were real currency. Dean replied that US dol -
lars are the currency that should really be questioned. After all, the dollar 
had been taken off the gold standard decades ago and was now backed by 
thin air. The dumpling, on the other hand, was backed by Ben & Jerry’s ice 
cream. (Seriously. Dean knows the founders.) And, as Dean pointed out, 
since ice cream is frozen to 32ºF (0ºC), it had “rock-solid backing.”
As I explored Dean’s home, I found on one wall what struck me as the 
most important document of all. It was a framed “Foreign Aid National 
Treasure Bond” to President Bush in which North Dumpling Island actually 
gave foreign aid to the United States—in the sum of $100.
I asked Dean for the story behind the picture. He told me that North 
Dumpling had become the first nation in the world to provide foreign aid 
to the United States. And here’s why, according to the certificate:
Once the technological leaders of the world, America’s Citizens 
have been slipping into Woeful Ignorance of and Dismaying Indif -
ference to the wonders of science and technology. This threatens the 
United States with Dire Descent into scientific and technological

illiteracy. . . . The Nation of North Dumpling Island hereby commits 
itself to helping rescue its neighbor Nation from such fate by 
 supporting the efforts of the Foundation for Inspiration and Recog -
nition of Science and Technology in promoting excellence in and 
appreciation of these disciplines among the peoples of the United 
States of America.  . . .”
Dean wasn’t giving $100 to a superpower as a joke. He was about to 
pull off yet another Brule-busting move using his newly formed role as an 
independent nation to do it. He was seeking to change the global education 
system to bring more attention to science and engineering.
Dean’s donation to the United States was for establishing FIRST  (For 
Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), an organization 
with a mission: “To transform our culture by creating a world where sci -
ence and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of 
becoming science and technology leaders.” FIRST does this through huge 
competitions where kids build robots of all kinds that compete in Olympic- 
like settings.
When I attended the FIRST robotics challenge in St. Louis, Missouri, in 
2015, some 37,000 teams from high schools around the world had com -
peted to get their robots to the finals. It was fantastic to see what those kids 
could build.
Dean said that he thinks one of the problems in the world today is that 
kids grow up idolizing sports superstars, and while there’s nothing wrong 
with idolizing athletic power, we also need to idolize brainpower—the engi-
neers, the scientists, the people who are moving humanity forward through 
innovation. That’s what he did with FIRST. And North Dumpling Island 
certainly helped fuel publicity for the organization.
Whether North Dumpling Island is really a nation is beside the point. 
What’s important is that Dean is a guy who plays at a different level from 
most people. He is constantly bending and breaking the rules in pursuit of 
a better way to live, hacking beliefs and cultural norms that most of us 
accept without questioning:
 ■ With his invention of the Segway, he redefined accepted models of 
transportation.

 ■ With North Dumpling Island, he playfully redefined the idea of the 
nation-state.
 ■ With FIRST, he redefined the idea of science education being as cool 
to teens as sports.
Extraordinary people think differently, and they don’t let their society’s 
Brules stop them from advocating for a better world for themselves. Neither 
should you. All of us have both the ability and responsibility to toss out the 
Brules that are preventing us from pursuing our dreams. It all starts with 
one thing: questioning your inherited beliefs.
You can use the same amazing brain that took those Brules onboard to 
uninstall them and replace them with beliefs that truly empower you. This 
idea alone can be hugely liberating. Which leads us to Law 2.
TAKING THE BRULES BY THE HORNS
We have to push our systems—internally and externally, personally and 
institutionally—to catch up. We do that by making the first move to 
uninstall Brules in our own minds and then exerting upward pressure on 
our social systems to evolve. It can feel a little like free fall when you first 
start—and it is, because you’re taking your life off of autopilot. Sometimes 
things feel chaotic while you take over the controls but have faith in your -
self. You were born to do this. The great gift of being human is our capacity 
to see the world anew, invent new solutions—and then use what we know 
to transform our lives and change our world. Culture isn’t static. It lives 
and breathes, made by us in real time in the flow of life, meant to change 
as our world changes. So, let’s do it! It starts at home, with you. Your life, 
on your terms.
Law 2: Question the Brules.
Extraordinary minds question the Brules when they feel those Brules are 
out of alignment with their dreams and desires. They recognize that much 
of the way the world works is due to people blindly following Brules that 
have long passed their expiration date.

Exercise: The Brule Test
So, what might your Brules look like? I’m not talking here about getting rid 
of moral and ethical standards that uphold the Golden Rule. But certain 
rules that lock us into long-held habits and irrational self-judgment could be 
worth a look (for example: I should work to the point of exhaustion every 
week or I’m not working hard enough . . . I should call my parents every day 
or I’m not being a good daughter/son . . . I should observe my religion the 
way my family does or I’m not a spiritual person . . . I should behave a cer-
tain way toward my mate or I’m not a good spouse . . . ) to see if a Brule is 
coming to call. Apply the five-question Brule Test for a reality check, and 
decide whether it’s a rule you want to live by or a Brule you want to bust.
Question 1: Is it based on trust and hope in humanity?
Is the rule based on the idea that human beings are primarily good or pri -
marily bad? If a rule is based on negative assumptions about humanity, I 
tend to question it.
For example, in the world today there’s a huge amount of guilt and 
shame about sex, and many rules around it. India recently tried to ban 
access to all pornography websites—but there was so much public outcry, 
the ban was ended four days later. That’s an example of a Brule based on 
the idea that humanity is primarily bad: Give people freedom to access porn 
online, and they’ll go berserk and become sexual deviants.
The Christian idea of original sin is another example of fundamental 
mistrust of humanity. It has caused so much guilt and shame for so many 
people who feel undeserving of success and good things in life. Original sin 
is an example of a relative truth. It’s held by one particular segment of the 
world population; i.e., it is not universally held across cultures. There’s no 
scientific evidence that we are born sinners, so it isn’t absolute truth. Yet it 
negatively affects millions.
Always have faith and trust in humanity. I like to remember Gandhi’s 
words: “You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a 
few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”
Question 2: Does it violate the Golden Rule?
The Golden Rule is to do unto others as you would want them to do unto 
you. Rules that elevate some while devaluing others are suspect as Brules—

 QUE ST ION THE BRUL ES 39
such as rules that grant or restrict opportunities based on skin color, sexual 
orientation, religion, nationality, whether a person has a penis or a vagina, 
or any other arbitrary or subjective criteria.
Question 3: Did I take it on from culture or religion?
Is this a rule or a belief that the majority of human beings weren’t born into 
believing? Is it a belief in a particular way of life or a rule about a very 
particular habit, such as a way of eating or dressing? If so, it’s probably a 
cultural or religious rule. If it bothers you, I believe you don’t have to follow 
it, just as I decided I would enjoy a steak or beef burger when I wanted to. 
Luckily for me, my family allowed me to question these rules, even though 
sometimes it might have made them uncomfortable.
You do not have to dress, eat, marry, or worship in a manner that you 
disagree with just because it’s part of the culture you’re born into. Culture is 
meant to be ever-evolving, ever-flowing—in a way, just like water. Water is 
most beautiful and useful when it’s moving—it creates rivers, waterfalls, the 
waves of the ocean. But when water becomes stagnant, it becomes poisonous. 
Culture is like water. If it’s stagnant, as in the case of dogma or the rules of 
fundamentalist religion, it can be poisonous. Appreciate your culture, but let 
it flow and evolve. Don’t buy into the dogma that your culture’s way of prayer, 
dress, food, or sexual conduct must stay the same as it was generations ago.
Question 4: Is it based on rational choice or contagion?
Are you following a rule because it was installed in you during childhood? Is 
it benefiting your life, or have you just never thought about doing things 
differently? We follow a large number of dangerously unhealthy rules merely 
because of memetics and social conditioning. Are they holding you back? If 
so, try to understand them, dissect them, and question them. Do they serve 
a purpose, or do you take them on merely by imitation? Ask yourself if these 
rules truly serve you and if you want to pass them down to your children. Or 
are these ideas—for example, ones about how to dress or traditional ideas of 
what is moral—stifling and restrictive. If so, let’s allow them to die a peace-
ful death and cut the cord so they do not end up infecting our children.
Question 5: Does it serve my happiness?
Sometimes we follow beliefs that don’t serve our happiness, but that feel as 
if they reflect an accepted and inescapable way of life. It could be following

a career path because our family or society tells us it’s correct (as happened 
to me with computer engineering), or marrying a particular person, or liv -
ing in a certain place or a certain way.
Place your happiness first. Only when you’re happy can you truly give your 
best to others—in society, in relationships, in your family and community.
It’s worth remembering these wise words from Steve Jobs when he was 
asked to address the graduating class at Stanford:
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. 
Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other 
people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out 
your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to fol -
low your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you 
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
IT’S TIME TO START QUESTIONING
What are some beliefs in your life you want to question? Pick a few and try 
applying the Brule Test. Then try a few more. Don’t rush, and don’t expect 
to wake up tomorrow free of all of your Brules just because you’ve figured 
out what they are. Brules are powerful, and it can be hard to look squarely 
at the ones that have had the most influence over you. Throughout this 
book I’ll be sharing strategies for throwing out your Brules and replacing 
them with new blueprints that will inspire greater happiness, connection, 
and success. But before you leap forward into a new life, you have to untan-
gle yourself from the old one. I like to recall the words of L. P. Hartley from 
the 1953 novel The Go-Between:  “The past is a foreign country: They do 
things differently there.” If so, this is your chance to cross the border, visit 
some place new and exciting, and discover a whole new way of life.
As you pursue this quest to question, know this: Certain people will tell 
you that you’re wrong, that you’re being unfaithful to your family, or to 
your tradition, or to your cultural norms. Or that you’re being selfish. 
Here’s what I want you to know. Some say the heart is the most selfish 
organ in the body because it keeps all the good blood for itself. It takes in

 QUE ST ION THE BRUL ES 41
all the good blood, the most oxygenated blood, and then distributes the rest 
to every other organ. So, in a sense maybe the heart is selfish.
But if the heart didn’t keep the good blood for itself, the heart would 
die. And if the heart died, it would take every other organ with it. The liver. 
The kidneys. The brain. The heart, in a way, has to be selfish for its own 
preservation. So, don’t let people tell you that you’re selfish and wrong to 
follow your own heart. I urge you, I give you permission, to break the rules, 
to think outside the norms of traditional society. The Brules of the father 
should not be passed on to the son.
LIFE BEYOND THE BRULES
When you start hacking your life in this way, you gain a new sense of 
power and control. With it comes accountability and responsibility for your 
actions. Since you’re deciding what rules you’ll follow, your life is up to you. 
You can’t hide behind excuses about who or what is holding you back. It’s 
also up to you to hack responsibly, applying the Brules Test to make sure 
you aren’t violating the Golden Rule as you go.
It takes a certain amount of courage to live in this way. When you hit a 
certain pain point with a Brule and realize that you cannot continue to live 
with it, part of abandoning it could feel like abandonment of an important 
social structure in your life. Life beyond the Brules can be scary and surprising 
and exhilarating—often all at once. People might push back or hassle you, but 
you must be prepared to stand firm in your pursuit of your own happiness.
I like to remember the advice from my friend Psalm Isadora, an actress 
and well-known tantra teacher: “The people making you feel guilty for 
going your own way and choosing your own life are simply saying, ‘Look 
at me. I’m better than you because my chains are bigger.’ It takes courage 
to break those chains and define your own life.”
So dare to live your precious days on Earth to their fullest, true to your-
self, with open heart and thoughtful mind, and with the courage to change 
what doesn’t work and accept the consequences. You may find that you can 
fly farther than you ever imagined.
“What if . . . all the rules and ways we lay down in our heads, 
don’t even exist at all? What if we only believe that they’re 
there, because we want to think that they’re there? All the

formalities of morality and the decisions that we see our -
selves making in order to be better (or the best)  . . .  what if 
we think we’ve got it all under control—but we don’t? What 
if the path for you is one that you would never dare take 
because you never saw yourself going that way? And then 
what if you realized that one day, would you take the path for 
you? Or would you choose to believe in your rules and your 
reasons? Your moralities and your hopes? What if your own 
hope, and your own morality, are going the other way?”

W
hen I was a kid, my dad enrolled me in Tae Kwan Do classes. 
Tae Kwan Do is a form of Korean karate that builds discipline 
and self-defense. I loved it. Every year, we’d strive to perfect 
our moves so we could achieve the next belt level. I started as a white belt 
and slowly ascended to yellow, green, blue, brown, and eventually the 
much-coveted black belt.
The belts were an elegant system dating back centuries that allowed 
students to rise to mastery level in attainable stages. It made growth easier 
and motivated students far more than a vague goal such as “become a mas-
ter.” Each belt was a treasured validation of our hard work and progress.
This book is layered like belts for consciousness. As you move from Part 
I to Part II, you will ascend to the next belt level in awareness. Humanity 
today is largely operating within the culturescape, or Level 1—trapped by 
Brules from generations past.
Once you start to see the culturescape for what it is, something within 
you will begin to change. Rather than follow the status quo, you will start 
to make your own rules. You will start to question. And the more you

question, the more your awareness will expand. The more your awareness 
expands, the more you will grow. And the more you grow, the more 
extraordinary your life will become.
At this point you’ve ascended to Level II: The Awakening. If I were to 
draw this on a napkin, it would look like this:
Think of the little Xs as the Brules of the culturescape. You’re rising 
beyond it by creating your own bubble within the culturescape where YOU 
make the rules.
At this higher level, your tool for influencing the world and creating 
your own growth is a practice I call consciousness engineering. Think of it 
as the interface between you and the culturescape around you. You decide 
what to let in or reject. You’re engineering how your consciousness is 
shaped and influenced.
What ideas and values (we’ll call these your models of reality) do you 
choose to believe? How do you choose to live, learn, and grow (we’ll call 
those your systems for living)? In the chapters that follow, you’ll select the 
models and systems that will advance your journey toward an extraordi -
nary life.
Level I: 
Life within the culturescape.  
The Xs represent potential Brules.
Level II: 
You learn to create your own version  
of the world within the culturescape. 
Within your world (the bubble around 
you), you can choose to eliminate  
and filter incoming Brules.

FROM COMPUTER ENGINEERING  
TO CONSCIOUSNESS ENGINEERING
Miserable as I was as a computer engineer, the training did give me one 
edge: a way of thinking that turns out to be perfect for challenging the 
Brules of the culturescape. It’s called computational thinking.
Computational thinking trains you to look at problems from all 
angles—to break down problems into processes and parts (decomposition), 
spot patterns (pattern recognition), and solve them in a very logical, linear 
fashion (algorithms). The goal is to come up not only with a solution but 
also with one that’s replicable, meaning that anyone—a man, woman, or 
child from India, Malaysia, or North America—could get the same results. 
Computational thinking makes you highly logical—and a very good prob -
lem solver. It’s what gives programmers and hackers their edge.

46 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
From the day I busted the beef Brule at the age of nine, I’ve wanted to hack 
everything about how I live. With my parents’ permission to question, I began 
looking at everything about life from the context of, “Why do we do this?”
But I never thought I’d be applying it to the human mind.
FROM BROKE FAILURE TO SUPER PERFORMER 
IN TEN MONTHS
To explain how I found the tools for extraordinary living that you’ll learn 
about in this and later chapters, I have to take you back to some lean years 
in my life.
I got into personal growth because I was going through a tough period. 
In 2001, fresh out of college, I moved to Silicon Valley to launch a start-up. 
I was twenty-five. This was a time before Y-Combinator, 500 Startups, or 
any of the other dozen or so programs that fund aspiring young engineers 
and their dot-com dreams. Money, especially for twenty-five-year-olds, 
wasn’t easy to come by. I took what savings I had, borrowed some money 
from my dad, and went out to try my luck.
My timing, in a word, sucked. A few months after moving to Silicon 
Valley, the dot-com bubble burst. I remember reading that 14,000 people 
had been laid off in April 2001. Pink slip parties—where the jobless go to 
network and drink themselves into comfort—became the norm. Broke and 
desperate, I sent my résumé to every job I could find on craigslist.org but 
got zero replies. Funds were so low I couldn’t afford to rent a room, much 
less an apartment. So I rented a couch.
And it wasn’t even a three-seater couch. It was a two-seater, so my legs 
dangled off at night when I went to bed. I was renting it from a Berkeley 
college student who was trying to optimize his finances by renting out his 
least-favorite piece of furniture. On that couch in Berkeley, and on the radi-
ator beside it, lay my entire life. All my clothes, my books, my laptop, and 
my shattered dreams. It was humbling to be living in a college town as a 
graduate with a computer engineering degree and realizing that most of the 
college students there were living in better conditions than I was.
Finally, one day, after another mind-numbing bout of sending my 
résumé to jobs on craigslist, I got a reply. It was from a company looking 
for people who would call law firms to sell case management software. It 
was a dialing-for-dollars job. And it was straight commission: If I didn’t

sell, I didn’t eat. The economy was so bad that startups could get away with 
paying no base salary.
I knew nothing about sales and marketing, but it was the only job I 
could get, so I took it.
On my first week in the office, we were assigned territories to cover. 
Mine was San Antonio, Texas.
Work looked like this: I’d have to go to the San Francisco Public Library, 
get a copy of the San Antonio Yellow Pages, look up law firms, and start 
dialing every attorney from A to Z to find one bored enough to listen to my 
pitch without hanging up on me. Since my boss doubted that any lawyer in 
Texas would be able to pronounce the name Vishen, I became Mr. Vincent 
Lakhiani for convenience.
My first few months on the job, I earned around $2,500 a month in 
commissions—hardly enough to survive on in the Bay Area.
But it’s often when we’re feeling down that we end up taking a step 
toward our next level of personal growth. Remember the drawing from 
Chapter 1 on how extraordinary lives are meant to be bumpy? I was in for 
another bump that would help me grow and learn.
Bored and mildly depressed, I began searching online for classes to take 
to help get my mind off the drudgery of my job. I can’t remember exactly 
what I typed into Google—maybe “hope,” maybe “success,” or maybe 
“why does life have to suck so bad.” And that’s when I saw it.
I noticed a class on meditation and intuition. It was in Los Angeles and 
seemed interesting, especially since the lecturer was in pharma sales and 
spoke about how these methods had allowed her to rapidly expand her sales 
volume. Sold! I rather impulsively decided to fly down and take the class. 
When I showed up, I was the only student there (meditation wasn’t as pop-
ular then as it is now). I completed the entire two-day class in one day and 
flew back to San Francisco that night.
Immediately I began applying some of the techniques I’d learned, one of 
which was a simple technique to meditate and get myself into the alpha state 
of mind. Alpha is a brain wave frequency common in meditation where 
you’re in a relaxed state. People who advocate this type of meditation say 
that alpha puts you highly in tune with your intuition, your creativity, and 
your problem-solving abilities. A key part of what I had learned was listen-
ing to my inner voice or intuition. I practiced this when making my phone 
calls. I stopped calling every lawyer from A to Z in the Yellow Pages, as my 
043-110_152510_CEM_P2.indd   47 3/4/16   12:33 PM

coworkers were doing. Instead, I’d go into a relaxed, meditative level of mind, 
run my finger down the listings, and call the ones where I felt an impulse. The 
impulse often felt like guessing, but I heeded it. I realize this makes no logical 
sense. But I discovered that listening to my impulse somehow caused me to 
call lawyers more likely to buy. My closing rate started rising rapidly.
How much of a change can you expect from studying meditation? I cer-
tainly didn’t expect much, other than learning to relax and destress better. 
But by the end of the first week after flying back from L.A., I had my best-
ever sales week. I assumed it was an aberration and that it wouldn’t last. 
But I closed two deals the next week. And the next. And it got better. A 
month later, I leveled up to closing three deals. Listening to my intuition 
seemed to triple the odds of my calling a receptive lawyer.
Other things improved, too. I started feeling happier and more positive 
about my days. My confidence and my rapport with people at work 
improved. I credit these to the fact that I was now meditating for about 
fifteen to thirty minutes every day, listening to my intuition and visualizing 
myself closing deals with ease.
Then I started using another technique I’d learned from another class: a 
simple empathy technique for connecting more effectively with people. 
Before speaking to a lawyer, I’d tell myself that I’d be able to connect with 
my potential client at a subconscious level, have empathy for his or her 
needs, know the right things to say at the right moment, and then—only if 
this was a software that would genuinely benefit the lawyer’s firm—close 
the sale. While in meditation, I would visualize the lawyer in front of me 
and imagine beaming genuine kindness and compassion toward him or her. 
I’d end the three-minute visualization with a mental affirmation that we’d 
close the deal if it was in the best interest of all the parties involved.
Again I saw a massive boost in my sales. Soon I was closing more than 
anyone in the company. And so, twenty-six-years-old and with no prior 
sales experience, I got promoted three times in the next four months and 
was made director of sales. In September of 2002, just nine months after I 
joined the company, my boss sent me to New York City to head up the 
company’s New York office.
I continued to grow within the company. I also continued experiment -
ing, adjusting, and refining my meditation practice. And with each refine -
ment, my abilities at work seemed to grow. Soon I was doing the jobs of 
two people—business development manager (managing the company’s

advertising spend on Google AdWords) and heading the New York office—
excelling in both roles. My salary had tripled in a few short months.
At the time, I couldn’t explain why all of this success was happening. I 
just knew that what I was doing worked.
COMPUTATIONAL THINKING MEETS 
PERSONAL GROWTH
My rapid success in the world of sales sparked my fascination with decod -
ing the human mind. I realized that we can improve our performance in 
logical ways—by, say, reading a book on sales—and there’s nothing wrong 
with that. But there are also techniques that can dramatically accelerate our 
performance. The ones I learned changed my life in just one week.
My computational thinking training kicked in, big-time. I wanted to 
break down human behavior—which at first glance appears like a huge, 
tangled knot of thoughts, actions, responses, emotions, impulses, drives, 
cravings, habits, and God knows what else—and crack the code for how we 
humans work.
As I got better at meditation and other conscious practices, it started to 
bother me that I’d been the only person in that class in Los Angeles. There 
was a lot more to learn. I wanted to teach others what had worked so 
awesomely for me. So I quit my software sales job and started a small 
e-commerce store. I called it Mindvalley. Our first products were nothing 
more than meditation CDs I sourced from established publishers. As Mind-
valley grew, I launched as many companies as I could, teaching people 
mindfulness, meditation, contemplative practices, how to have better rela -
tionships, nutrition, health, wellness—basically, the knowledge that we 
truly need in order to have richer, healthier, more meaningful lives—knowl-
edge that our industrial-age education system had failed to teach us. Soon 
we were publishing many of America’s leading thinkers in health, wellness 
and consciousness from Ken Wilber to JJ Virgin to Michael Beckwith. I 
started Mindvalley with nothing more than $700 in 2003. Twelve years 
later, with not a single bank loan and no venture capital money, the company 
had grown to 200 employees and more than 500,000 paying students.
In that time I got to know at a deep personal level many of America’s top 
minds in human development. I spent nine days at the invitation of author 
and motivational speaker Tony Robbins on his Fiji estate. I hooked my

brain to electrodes with famed biohacker Dave Asprey to study different 
levels of consciousness. I met masters and gurus from India, billionaires at 
the peak of their game, and legends in business and society. And with every 
meeting, interview, and experience, I began dissecting, assimilating, and 
assembling the framework that helped create this book.
Today, I obsessively seek out new models and systems for how we can 
best understand ourselves and reach levels of potential we’ve only dreamed 
about. My hacker mentality pushes me to always be looking for the most 
effective solution that is replicable—that brings extraordinary results 
within reach of the greatest number of people. This is how I developed the 
model I’m about to share with you: consciousness engineering.
AN OPERATING SYSTEM  
FOR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
If you have a computer, you’ve probably had to install a new operating sys-
tem from time to time. Windows 95 gave way to Windows 8 over the last 
two decades. And the boring 1996 Macintosh computers I used as a fresh -
man at the University of Michigan gave way to the gorgeous Mac iOS we 
see powering MacBooks today. Every few years, we upgrade our operating 
systems on our machines to make our computers run faster, better, and take 
on increasingly complex tasks with ease.
But how many of us even think about doing the same for ourselves? 
Consciousness engineering is an operating system for the human mind. And 
the beauty of it is that—like the best hacks—it’s really simple. It all boils 
down to just two things.
1. Your Models of Reality (Your Hardware)
Your models of reality are your beliefs about the world. In Chapter 2, we 
talked about how most of the rules we accept as true exist inside our heads 
and were put there, as Steve Jobs said, “by people no smarter than you.” 
Human society today runs on the accumulated beliefs of our forefathers: 
Our economic systems, definitions of marriage, the food we eat, our meth -
ods of schooling and work—these structures were created long ago by peo -
ple in very different settings than what we live in today.

 PRA CT ICE CON SCIOU SNESS ENGIN EERING  51
Some of us were raised with empowering beliefs about ourselves and the 
world. Yet most of us also have at least a few sickly, disempowering beliefs 
that hold us back. The important thing to realize is that no matter what 
these beliefs are, they became true because we act and think in accordance 
with them. Thus, our beliefs truly do shape our world in a very real sense.
But while your beliefs make you, your beliefs are NOT you. You can use 
consciousness engineering to swap out old beliefs, swap in new ones, and 
take on new understandings of the world that might serve you better.
Using our computer analogy, think of your models of reality as your hard-
ware. Want a faster machine or a better resolution monitor? Just swap the 
older model and replace it with the latest model. Need more space? Replace 
your 250 meg hard drive with a 500 meg drive. Beliefs are like that, too. 
When an old belief no longer serves you, you have every right to swap it out. 
Yet we don’t. When you use the Brule Test to challenge your Brules and swap 
out obsolete Brules for rules that work better, you’re upgrading your hard-
ware so your operating system works optimally. In people-speak, that means 
you’re choosing what to believe, and your life is yours to control.
Replacing outdated models of reality is essential. Our models of reality 
do more than just create our feelings around an event or life in general. To 
an astonishing extent, they seem to influence the reality of the world that 
we experience every single day.
What You Think Is What You Get
Our models of reality make us who we are. The problem is, as we saw in 
Chapter 2, that many of them weren’t taken on by rational choice but rather 
by imitation. Our beliefs about life, love, work, parenting, our bodies, our 
self-worth—are often a result of our innate tendency to imitate the people and 
practices around us. What you think and believe about the world shapes who 
you are and your experience of the world around you. Change your accepted 
models of reality, and dramatic changes will happen in your world.
For example, researchers Ellen Langer, PhD, and Alia J. Crum, PhD, set 
up a study, reported in 2007 in Psychological Science , in which they asked 
84 hotel maids how much they exercised. You’d think that with all the 
physical work involved with cleaning hotel rooms, they would have 
answered, “A helluva lot!” But although they cleaned about fifteen rooms 
a day, one-third said they didn’t get any exercise, and the other two-thirds

said they didn’t exercise on a regular basis. Now, as anyone who has just 
completed a weekend of housecleaning can tell you, cleaning a room, 
changing sheets, vacuuming, and so on is a lot of work. Yet according to 
their model of reality, the maids didn’t consider their work activities to be 
“exercise.” That seemed to be borne out when the researchers assessed the 
women and found that they seemed about as fit as sedentary folks.
Here’s where it gets interesting. The researchers implanted a new model 
of reality in the maid’s minds. They informed forty-four of the maids that 
their daily duties met the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) activity 
guidelines and surpassed the Surgeon General’s guidelines. They also gave 
the maids a rundown of calorie counts for various cleaning activities and 
put similar information where the maids could see it at work. In short, they 
flipped a belief switch. They gave the maids new information about their 
existing habits that showed how the work they did was, in fact, exercise.
A month passes. The researchers follow up. Incredibly, the maids who’d 
been given the fitness information had, on average, lost two pounds, had 
lower blood pressures, and overall “were significantly healthier” based on 
measurements of their body fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip 
ratio. And guess what? The maids told the researchers of no changes in 
their actions. The only change was in the information they’d been given—
the truth the researchers had provided. The researchers had successfully 
swapped out an old model of reality and implanted a new one. They made 
the maids view their work as “exercise.” And the results caused actual 
physical changes in the bodies of the maids.
The researchers concluded that what’s become known as the placebo 
effect—results that appear to come purely from a person’s mind-set instead 
of from a specific medication or medical treatment—plays a role when it 
comes to exercise.
Amazing, isn’t it? Measurable positive change—just from installing a 
new belief that their work was actually healthy work. Imagine the implica -
tions this could have for how we encourage employees to be more engaged 
in their work or how we encourage people to lose weight. If the mind is so 
powerful that it can actually change health based on a changed perspective, 
imagine what that could mean about the mind’s power to control our 
mood, our self-confidence, our happiness, and everything else that deter -
mines the quality of our time here on Earth.

not you, they make you who you are. When you realize that, you can swap 
out a bad or outdated model, swap in a healthier one, and gain incredible 
power to shift your world. Let’s return for a moment to our computer hard-
ware analogy. If your computer hardware can’t handle the tasks you need 
it to do, you get a faster, more powerful computer, a higher-quality moni -
tor, a better mouse. Look how sleek and efficient our computers have 
become in the last thirty years. Wouldn’t it be great to think with that same 
level of elegance, speed, and efficiency? Yet when it comes to updating our 
models of reality, most us are stuck with the 1980s Macintosh rather than 
the new iMac. We hold on to our old models and deny ourselves an upgrade.
The hotel maids in the study lost weight and got healthier simply because 
a new belief was installed in them. What would happen to you if you 
swapped in new beliefs about your love life? Your work? Your body? Your 
ability to make money? We’ll explore how to do this in the next chapter.
As I’ve learned about the power of beliefs, I’ve chosen specific models of 
reality to help me stay healthier and younger. I’ve decided I’m going to live to 
be one hundred. I’ve chosen a model where seven minutes of early-morning 
exercise gets me the same results as hours in a gym. As a result, I’ve been 
able to get fitter and develop a better body in my forties than I had in my 
twenties. I’ve also decided on a belief that work is one of the most pleasur-
able things in life—so I enjoy what I do on a daily basis. All of us have this 
ability to decide what models of belief we’ll adopt. You get to choose.
Thus the single most effective model of reality you can adopt right now is 
the idea that your models of reality are swappable. You do not have to continue 
believing and seeing the world through the lens installed within you in your 
younger years. I’ll show you how to swap in a new, optimal set of beliefs in the 
next chapter. But first there’s another important part of the picture to look at.
2. Your Systems for Living (Your Software)
Your habits, or systems for living, are how you put your models of reality 
into practice. If models of reality are the hardware of the human “machine,” 
systems for living are the software. They’re your activities and daily  
habits—for example, how you eat (based on your beliefs about nutrition), 
how you work (based on your beliefs about what kind of career and work 
behaviors are acceptable), and how you deal with money (based on your 
beliefs about the ease of acquiring money or the guilt or honor of having

lots of it). There are many others, from how you raise your kids to how you 
make love, make friends, work out, solve problems, finish a project at work, 
make a difference in the world, and have fun.
Systems of living are easy to acquire. You can always learn new ones. The 
problem is that our Industrial Age school system hasn’t done a very good job 
of keeping us up to date with the best systems for functioning in the world. 
Nobody taught us optimal ways to exercise, love, parent, eat, or even to speed-
read or improve longevity. I think of them like apps you can easily download 
and update, intended for specific purposes or to solve specific problems. Not 
working? Download the new version that fixes old bugs. Found a better one? 
DELETE. The trick is recognizing what systems you’re running and doing 
enough self-checks to quickly identify the ones you need to upgrade.
All of this now brings us to Law 3.
THE LIMITATIONS OF TODAY’S MODELS OF 
REALITY AND SYSTEMS FOR LIVING
Our current models and systems have three limitations:
1. Our models of reality are programmed by the world we grew up in.
2. Our models of reality (good or bad) determine our systems for 
living. In short, bad beliefs create bad habits.
3. Our modern models and systems are lacking in conscious practices—
we’re only just beginning to realize the power of our minds.
To understand these three limitations, we need to look at our current 
world from the outside in. Getting outside our culturescape is easier said 
than done. That’s why, in order to understand how we can improve our 
models and systems, I decided to journey to visit a culture far removed from 
the modern Western world.
Law 3: Practice consciousness engineering.
Extraordinary minds understand that their growth depends on two things: 
their models of reality and their systems for living. They carefully curate the 
most empowering models and systems and frequently update themselves.

Strange Lessons from the Amazon Rain Forest
Kristina and I arrived in the deep Ecuadorian Amazon just before sunset. 
Our small plane took off from a run-down town called Puyo on the border 
of the jungle and flew over a sea of green before landing on a dirt airstrip 
smack in the center of the rain forest. A boat ride, a hike, and several hours 
later, we were at Tingkias, a village belonging to a family of the Achuar 
tribe. The nearest “civilized” town was more than one hundred miles away. 
Around us was nothing but green, humid jungle and the sounds of count -
less birds and animals. Here we would spend the next five days, living 
life in a radically different culture where many of the norms of human 
civilization—from how we sleep to how we care for our bodies to how we 
drink water or worship a higher power—were completely challenged.
The Achuar people of the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador evolved for 
generations with little contact with the wider outside world. They only 
became known to the Western world in 1977, so being with them is about 
as close as you can get to visiting a culture relatively untouched by modern 
human beings. With minimal exposure to the modern culturescape, their 
models of reality are dramatically different from ours. I’m not talking about 
conventional things that we expect other cultures to do differently—like 
food, dress, music, and dance. I’m talking about things so different that if 
we were to read about them in a historical text, we would find it hard to 
believe that these were normal human beings alive on the planet today.
Many truths that we assume to be absolute, such as “drink water” or 
“eat breakfast,” are meaningless to them. Living with the Achuar was 
eye-opening. What I saw there profoundly shifted my thinking about what 
I believe to be acceptable truths.
Lesson 1: Our Models of Reality Are Programmed by the 
World We Grew Up In
By the time you arrive at the village, you’re ready for a bath and a long 
drink of water. You can bathe in the pond nearby. But if you want a 
drink of water, you’re out of luck. Because the water you bathed in—
where everyone in the tribe bathes and swims, too—is the only water 
around. And it’s filled with bacteria that would not be wise to ingest.
We assume that all human beings drink water. You might even consider 
that it’s an absolute truth, as we discussed in Chapter 1. But the Achuar

have evolved a brilliant hack for the fact that there’s no clean water in the 
Amazon. The women harvest, boil, and mash yucca roots and then repeat -
edly chew and spit the chewed-up root into a bowl. They mix this combo of 
yucca and saliva with pond water and leave it for several days. The mixture 
ferments, yielding alcohol, which kills the bacteria. What you end up with 
isn’t water, but chicha, a beer of sorts, made from the fermented spit of the 
tribeswomen. Every woman has her own brew, which she makes for her 
husband (men can have more than one wife) and children. Every woman’s 
brew tastes different, based on the taste of her saliva. The women spend 
hours each day chewing and spitting to make chicha while the men go hunt-
ing. It’s a big job, since this is all that the tribe drinks.
How does chicha taste? Well, to me, really awful, only because I haven’t 
been trained to appreciate it. To the Achuar, it tastes delicious, and the men 
come home from a long hunt craving it. It sounds weird to us, but it’s totally 
normal for them, and it’s how they survive in one of the most challenging 
places on Earth to live.
Is drinking water normal? It is to most of humanity. But to the Achuar, 
drinking water is unusual and distasteful. Our definition of what is normal 
is nothing more than what is programmed into us.
What we see as our culture is really nothing more than a quirk of his -
tory. It’s not necessarily right or wrong. Just like the Achuar way of living 
isn’t right or wrong. Our culture is the result of thousands of years of ideas 
emerging, clashing, and dissolving, battling for dominance. But I can assure 
you of one thing: Our culture wasn’t created by pure rational choice. In 
many ways it took form merely by imitation and chance. Yet we cling to our 
culture, both the good and the bad, as if it’s the only way of living. When 
you look at the Achuar and you look at us, you see that pretty much every 
aspect of human culture—of life as we live it day to day—is malleable, up 
for grabs, within our control, and open for questioning.
Lesson 2: Our Models of Reality (Good or Bad) Determine 
Our Systems for Living
The Achuar don’t have a model of reality for God in the way that most humans 
beings do. Instead, they believe that animals and plants possess human souls 
and that these souls have the ability to communicate through language and 
signs. To communicate with this world, they drink ayahuasca (a natural plant-

based drug) that induces vivid visions and metaphysical experiences.
I decided to experience the ayahuasca ceremony with a visiting shaman 
who was stopping by our village. I knelt on a platform before him. In the 
darkness I could not see his face, only the flicker of light from the tobacco 
leaves he smoked. It was a surreal moment, like stepping back centuries in 
time to an ancient culture. The shaman mumbled some words, blew smoke 
in my face, tapped me with a branch, and then gave me a tiny taste of the 
precious ayahuasca.
Everything seemed fine for a moment. Then suddenly: unbearable pain 
in my stomach. I fell to my knees as the pain hit, hung my head over the 
edge of the platform, and started vomiting violently as my guides held my 
arms and legs to prevent me from falling off the platform onto the jungle 
floor. After four to five minutes I stopped vomiting but was so weak I could 
barely walk. I was helped to a hammock. As soon as I closed my eyes, all I 
could see were fractals. It was as if the world were a series of interlocking 
triangles of all different colors spinning, pivoting, and merging.
When I opened my eyes and turned on my side to stare out at the jungle, 
the trees looked like huge, friendly monsters of the type you’d see in the 
book Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak. It was as if Sendak’s 
famous line: “Let the wild rumpus start!” had somehow been signaled in 
my brain. I don’t know how long I stared at the tree monsters before I felt 
the urge to fall asleep, but closing my eyes thrust me into that mesmerizing 
world of dancing fractals forming random shapes.
I felt scared at first, but the fear turned into a sense of sublime peace. I felt 
a oneness with the forest, the trees, the humidity, and the sky. It was a beauti-
ful feeling of being completely in the now with no regard for the past or 
future. It felt good to be alive. Eventually I fell asleep and woke later as dawn 
broke, when I joined the rest of the group to eat and discuss our experiences.
The beliefs of the Achuar in the spirit of the forest led to their system for 
experiencing the divine through ayahuasca.  Similarly many of our systems 
for living evolved as our culture did—in response to certain beliefs of the 
time. But in modern times they evolve into habits because of, well, just 
habit. We’ve done them for so long we don’t even know how we got started. 
We accept our current systems as “just the way things are,” but look deeper 
and you’ll see that these systems stem from beliefs from the past that you 
may have absorbed through the culture you were raised in.

58 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
Lesson 3: Our Modern Models and Systems Are Lacking in 
Conscious Practices
Many of our models and systems are rooted in the purely physical aspects 
of life—what we eat, how we take care of our bodies, beauty regimens, and 
so on. But until recently, there’s been almost no innovation in the systems 
that improve the way our minds and spirits function.
The Achuar wake up each day at 4:00 a.m. and assemble as a tribe around 
a fire to drink a certain type of tea called wayusa. While drinking their tea, 
they also share life experiences, problems, worries, and dreams from the 
previous night. Most of us don’t remember our dreams without effort. We 
tend to see them as fleeting images, soon forgotten in the serious business of 
the day. But the Achuar view their experiences during the day and at night as 
equally important and seem to simultaneously live in the waking and dream 
states. In the blending of these worlds, they solve problems, have adventures, 
and communicate with one another and with the spirit realm. They share 
these events while drinking their tea, and the elders listen and advise. The 
morning tea is a ritual for mental and spiritual cleansing.
Are the Achuar simply gifted at remembering dreams? Perhaps. But there 
might be more to it. We had journeyed into the jungle with the celebrated phi-
lanthropist and aid worker Lynne Twist. Lynne told me how she had come in 
contact with the Achuar. She’d repeated dreams of indigenous people with 
distinctive red markings on their faces. They seemed to be calling to her for 
help. When she described these visions to friends, one remarked that the faces 
she described looked much like the Achuar. That’s how Lynne came to Ecua-
dor to meet the tribe. The Achuar are facing eviction from their centuries-old 
home due to logging and oil and gas companies cutting large swaths of the 
Amazon. Lynne, working with the Ecuadorian government and the Achuar, 
has helped create laws to protect as much as four million acres of rainforest.
And it all started with visitors who seemed to enter her dreams call -
ing for her to help. Are dreams more than what we in the modern world 
make them out to be? Perhaps there’s something to the Achuar early-  
morning commitment to exploring the dream world.
Just how much of these spiritual experiences and abilities are we lacking in 
our modern world? Perhaps similar to the Himba tribespeople who have diffi-
culty seeing the color blue, are we blind to certain spiritual experiences?
We’re physical beings, and we evolve our physical systems very fast. 
Think of all the new diet and exercise routines you’ve heard or read about 
043-110_152510_CEM_P2.indd   58 3/4/16   12:33 PM

in just the past year or so. Yet our spiritual evolution is stuck in the past. 
Many of us are dissatisfied with the dogma of conventional religion; that’s 
not new. But it’s only been fairly recently that we’ve come to realize that the 
spiritual landscape is vast and varied and offers many options besides par -
ticipating in your family’s religion. I believe our spiritual systems need a 
major leveling up. That’s why I was so struck by the Achuar morning ritual 
of sharing their dreams and cleansing their minds while drinking the morn-
ing tea that cleanses their bodies.
In the next two chapters, we’ll talk about new models and systems that 
are evolving to help our minds catch up with our bodies.
THE ODDITY OF CULTURE?
We might consider their lives bizarre, but to the Achuar, we seem bizarre. We 
run off to stressful jobs, leaving our kids in the care of others. We sit and stare 
at a lit-up screen for most of the day. Then we exercise like maniacs to burn 
off the calories we consumed the day before. We pack our elders into commu-
nal homes and then worry about how to care for them. We take pills to keep 
from feeling fear and other emotions we believe are negative. We drink potions 
to stay awake. Then we take pills to put ourselves to sleep. We eat and drink 
too much, partly because we have more than we need and partly because we’re 
stressed out. Every tribe has its troubles. But the Achuar taught me that what 
we consider real, what we define as culture, what we believe is true about 
life—the nine-to-five, marriage, the way we raise our kids, how we treat our 
elders, what we do all day—are just collections of beliefs and practices that we 
put together because, well, they seemed like good ideas at the time. When you 
become aware of this fact, you also gain the ability to transcend and evolve 
these cultural practices.
LEVELING UP OUR INNER GAME
I once got to meet a man who many say is one of the most brilliant minds 
alive today. Ken Wilber is the most widely translated academic writer in 
America, with twenty-five books translated into some thirty foreign lan -
guages. Wilber is the originator of an extremely comprehensive philosophy 
called Integral Theory, which is a sort of theory of everything that unifies the 
disciplines of cultural studies, anthropology, systems theory, developmental

psychology, biology, and spirituality, to name just a few. Ken has been 
quoted by everyone from Bill Clinton to Kermit the Frog, and Integral The-
ory has been applied in fields as diverse as ecology, sustainability, psycho -
therapy, psychiatry, education, business, medicine, politics, sports, and art. 
As part of the research for this book, I spent five hours interviewing Wilber 
about human development models and how consciousness evolves.
One of the questions I asked Ken was what’s your vision of an ideal 
education curriculum for children? This is what Ken told me:
Humanity is flying way under its full potential simply because we do 
not educate for the whole or complete human being. We educate for just 
a small part, a slice, a fragment of just what’s possible for us. . . . Because 
according to the great wisdom traditions around the world—not only 
do humans possess typical states of consciousness like waking, dream-
ing, or deep sleep, they also possess profoundly high states of conscious-
ness like enlightenment or awakening—and none of our education 
systems teach ANY of that. Now, all of these factors I’ve mentioned . . . 
none of these are rare, isolated, esoteric, far-out, strange, or occult. 
They are all some of the very most basic and most fundamental poten-
tials of a human being everywhere. They are simply human 101. Yet we 
don’t educate human 101. We educate something like human 1/10. So 
yes, I firmly believe that we can bring about health on this planet for the 
planet and the humans on it if we started educating the whole person 
with all their fundamental potentials and capacities and skills and 
stopped this fragmented, partial, broken system that we have now.
Consciousness engineering isn’t just about being happy—though happi -
ness is a wonderful by-product. It’s about getting to human 101 and beyond 
and striving to be at the highest level of human development we can be, so 
we can fulfill our highest potential and, as the saying goes, leave this world 
a little better for our having been in it.
While there are many ways to get beyond human 101, I’ve found the 
framework of consciousness engineering to be the most powerful tool, since 
all growth comes from changing your models of reality or upgrading a 
system for living.
Changing a model of reality is a form of growth that often comes from 
epiphany or insight. It’s a sudden awakening or revelation that shifts a

 PRA CT ICE CON SCIOU SNESS ENGIN EERING  61
belief. Once you adopt a new model of reality that is superior to an older 
model, you can’t go back. It’s what happened to me when I moved from 
seeing work as a job to seeing my work as my calling. Or when someone 
moves from following a religion to discovering spirituality.
Changing a system for living, on the other hand, is a process change. It’s 
a step-by-step upgrade of a given process—as when you learn to go from 
riding a bicycle to driving a car as a means for mobility.
Once you understand the consciousness engineering approach, you can 
view yourself as a highly tuned operating system ready to install new hard-
ware (models of reality) or new apps (systems for living) when needed. You 
never get attached to the ones you have because you know newer, better 
ones are always being discovered.
In short, you view yourself as always ready for change and growth.
How to Speed Up Your Learning Rate
Consciousness engineering primes you to learn and grow much faster than 
before because it creates a mental map in your brain.
Elon Musk was once asked in a Reddit.com Q&A: “How do you learn 
so fast?”

62 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
He replied: “It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic 
tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk 
and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing 
for them to hang on to.”
As you think of your personal growth, think of consciousness engineer -
ing as that trunk. The two big branches are models of reality and systems 
for living. Everything you study in personal growth will either be a model 
(a new belief about money, for example) or a system (say, a new exercise or 
diet routine). These things cling to the two big branches.
I’ve found that by keeping this idea in mind, I can learn and grow faster 
than ever before. Once you internalize consciousness engineering, every 
time you pick up a book to read on personal growth or health, or an auto -
biography of a great leader, you start to look for model upgrades that you 
can swap in and new systems you can adopt.
In the next two chapters we’ll refine this learning process by showing you 
exactly HOW to upgrade your models and systems in the best way possible.
Each of us has so much untapped capability. We’re reminded of it every 
time we hear stories of triumphs of will and ingenuity—whether it’s an inno-
vation by someone like Dean Kamen, one of America’s greatest inventors, or 
a citizen standing up for honor in the community. We call it all kinds of 
things—courage, brilliance, vision, even miracle. But consciousness engineer-
ing on a regular basis catapults us into becoming our best, most extraordi -
nary selves. And that, my fellow hackers, is within reach of every one of us.
Here’s an important exercise. Consciousness engineering works best 
when applied in a holistic way across our lives. In order to do that, we need 
to understand two things: First, we need to identify the key areas of our 
lives where we can apply consciousness engineering, and second, we need 
to pinpoint which of those areas could use some rebalancing.
Exercise: The Twelve Areas of Balance
My friend Jon Butcher is the owner of Precious Moments, the famous 
American catalog order company that sells giftware in the form of cute 
porcelain dolls. He’s one of the most successful entrepreneurs in America 
today, but what is really unique about Jon is how superbly well balanced 
his life is. He seems to have it all—wealth, success, a perfect marriage, 
great kids, and a life filled with adventure. For example, Jon’s a grandfa -
ther, but he’s in such great health, you’d mistake him for a forty-year-old.

Jon’s secret, he claims, is how he sets his goals in life.
Jon divided his life into twelve categories, and for each category he 
mapped out his beliefs, his vision, his strategy, and his purpose. It’s goal set-
ting at the deepest level. When Jon’s friends asked him what his secret was, 
he would teach them his system. It eventually evolved into Lifebook, a per-
sonal growth seminar you can take in Chicago, where you spend four days 
diving deep into different aspects of your life to create a detailed life plan.
The idea I’m sharing here is partially inspired by Jon Butcher’s Lifebook 
seminar, which I attended in 2010. I’ve adapted the categories (my own 
twelve are different from Jon’s) for this exercise to help you discover the 
models and systems you’re applying in your life so that you can begin to 
consider where you need to upgrade. I call them the Twelve Areas of Balance. 
Each area influences and shapes you in an important way. This exercise will 
help you elevate yourself on every level, leaving no part of your life behind.
Ready to start your adventure in consciousness engineering? Here goes:
When you think of your life and where you want to grow, think holisti-
cally. Too many people live lives lacking in balance. They may have great 
wealth but lousy relationships with their family. Or they may be incredibly 
fit and healthy but struggle with debt. Or they may have a career filled with 
achievements but feel heartbroken and lonely. An extraordinary life is bal -
anced on all levels. Thinking holistically will help you make sure you don’t 
end up winning in one area but losing in another. I use the Twelve Areas of 
Balance to help keep an even keel, and now it’s your turn.
For each category below, rate your life on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being 
“very weak” and 10 being “extraordinary.” If you have a pen handy, write 
your rating next to each category now. Don’t think about each item for too 
long. Often the first impulse—your gut check—is the most accurate.
1. YOUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP. This is the measure of how happy you 
are in your current state of relationship—whether you’re single and 
loving it, in a relationship, or desiring one. Your rating: _________

Where We Learn to Choose and Upgrade 
Our Beliefs
Our beliefs are like unquestioned commands, telling us how 
things are, what’s possible and impossible and what we can 
and cannot do. They shape every action, every thought, and 
every feeling that we experience. As a result, changing our 
belief systems is central to making any real and lasting change 
in our lives.

ADVICE FROM A MONK IN A HOT TUB
“Do you have time right now?” the young monk asks me. “Let’s go 
talk.”
Did I have time? It was our last night in Fiji. We were sitting around a 
large table, enjoying one of the grandest meals I’ve ever seen. It was 2009 
and my then business partner, Mike, and I were guests at a nine-day 
advanced meditation retreat at Namale, a magnificent resort owned by 
author and world-famous trainer Tony Robbins. Our group was an inter -
esting assortment that included Hollywood actors, a stock market prodigy, 
and a former Miss America—plus the monks from India who led the 
retreat. I was honored that Tony and his wife had invited me to join this 
group and experience their beautiful island home.

66 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
It was a celebratory close to nine days of intensive self-exploration, dur-
ing which we tried to truly understand ourselves and our potential. And on 
the final day, we were told we would have a private consultation with a 
monk who would give us a “revelation.”
For reasons I’ll never know, my monk decided to have his consultation 
with me in the middle of this sumptuous dinner, just after my third glass of 
wine.
But when your monk calls, you listen. “Where would you like to go?” I 
ask.
“Let’s go to the hot tub,” he says.
Naturally.
We go to the open-air hot tub under the starry Fijian sky. I climb in. He 
sits on the edge, dipping his feet into the water. He looks at me and says:
“You know what your problem is?
“No,” I respond, surprised and, to be honest, mildly annoyed, “What is 
my problem?
“You have low self-esteem.”
What the . . . ?
“I don’t think so,” I reply, as reasonably as I can, trying to hide my 
growing irritation. “I think I’m pretty confident. I run a business. I’m 
thrilled with my life—”
“No no no no no.” He cuts me off. “You have low self-esteem. This is 
the cause of all your problems. I’ve observed you. When you’re brainstorm-
ing with your partner and he shoots down one of your ideas, you get agi -
tated and defensive. I bet you have issues with your wife, and I bet you have 
issues with others. You cannot take criticism. It’s all because of one thing: 
You have low self-esteem.”
It was like a smack in the face. The warm water in the hot tub no longer 
felt so comforting. The monk was dead-on. And after nine days of medita -
tion and self-reflection, I was more open to this sort of insight, even if it 
was painful to hear.
I was overly defensive in brainstorming meetings, especially with my 
business partner. I did often feel hurt or misunderstood in family situations. 
But the real problem wasn’t that someone was shooting down my idea, not 
listening to me, or misunderstanding me. It all boiled down to a deeply 
buried belief that I, by myself, was not enough.

It was why I got defensive in meetings. I felt the dismissal of my ideas as 
a dismissal of me.
It’s why I became an entrepreneur. To prove I was worthy and enough.
It’s why I built the most beautiful office in my city. To prove I could 
do it.
It was why I became wealthy. To prove something.
I could see how this belief that I needed to prove that I was enough—this 
model of reality I’d held for so long—had driven me into the arms of suc -
cess. But I could also see how the idea that I had to prove myself had caused 
great pain in my life. Was it possible that without this limiting belief, I 
might be even more successful in my work and relationships—without pay -
ing such a high personal price?
What might happen if I developed a 
belief that I was enough and had noth -
ing to prove?
Our models of reality are often 
unknown to us. Some models we know 
we have. For example, I know I believe 
in the importance of having a calling, 
in the power of gratitude, and in being 
kind to the people I work with. But we also have models of reality embed -
ded deep within that we’re mostly unaware of. What you know you believe 
is much smaller than what you don’t know you believe.
LESSON 1: Our models of reality 
lie below the surface. Often we 
do not realize we have them 
until some intervention or 
contemplative practice makes us 
aware.

68 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
Much of growing wiser and moving toward the extraordinary is really 
about becoming aware of the models of reality that you carry with you 
without realizing it.
I was unaware I had a belief that I was not enough. Identifying it and 
learning to resolve it made a huge impact on the quality of my life and how 
I behaved as a friend, colleague, and lover.
In this chapter we’ll explore how the world of our past infused us with 
certain beliefs—and how these beliefs now shape the world of our present 
and future. We’ll also explore how we can become more aware of our hid-
den models and then how to swap the unhealthy ones with updated models. 
The first step is to discover how we take on these models.
THE GIRL AT THE DANCE
Where does this belief of “I am not enough” and other limiting models of 
reality come from? For most of us, they come from our childhood.
I grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but was of northern Indian ori -
gin, so I looked different from the other kids at my school, who were of 
Chinese or Southeast Asian origin. I had skin of a different color, a bigger 
nose, more body hair. It was tough being a minority kid. I was ridiculed 
and called names in elementary school, including Gorilla Boy because I had 
hair on my legs and Hook Nose because of my large Roman nose. As a 
result, I grew up believing I was different. I hated my long nose and my 
“gorilla” legs.
When I turned thirteen, my father enrolled me in a private school for 
expat children. Surrounded by diversity, with kids from some fifteen coun -
tries in my class, I felt somewhat normal. But adolescence had other chal -
lenges. I developed severe chronic acne that landed me in dermatologists’ 
offices, and I was on frequent acne medication by age sixteen. That earned 
me yet another name at school: Pimple Face. It got worse. By my teen years, 
my eyes had deteriorated to the point where I had to wear glasses with 
superthick lenses. They broke frequently, and I’d patch them with tape, 
making me a walking stereotype of the nerd with tape on his glasses. As 
you can imagine, teenage life for me was not particularly easy.
My negative beliefs about my appearance wrecked my confidence for the 
first decades of my life. I was socially awkward. I hardly went out with

friends. I had crushes on girls but never had the guts to ask anyone out.
In college at the University of Michigan, I saw myself as the engineering 
geek, the guy girls might want as a friend but no one wanted to date. Thus I 
found myself at twenty-two, a college junior, never having had a girlfriend.
Then something changed. And it started with a kiss.
It happened at a college dance. I’d had one too many beers, which is 
probably the only reason I was dancing with the prettiest girl in the room. 
Her name was Mary. I’d known her for years and had always admired her, 
but she was way out of my league.
To this day I don’t know what came over me, but while we were danc -
ing, I leaned in and kissed her. Immediately I pulled back, babbling some -
thing like, “I’m so sorry—I didn’t mean to do that.” I expected Mary to be 
offended. 
Instead, she looked at me and said, “Are you kidding? You’re f**king 
hot.” Then the prettiest girl in the room grabbed me and locked her lips 
with mine. One thing led to another, and that ended up being one of the 
most amazing nights of my college life.
When a model of reality changes, the way you operate in the world 
changes, too. I woke the next day feeling as if I’d awakened in a whole new 
reality. If Mary, the prettiest girl in the room, thought I was hot, maybe I 
wasn’t so unattractive, and maybe other women could think so, too.
That single realization ended my belief that I was invisible to women. It 
radically transformed my ability to communicate with the opposite sex. 
Thanks to Mary, my dating life took off. Nothing about my appearance 
had changed. But armed with a new model of reality about my attractive -
ness, I suddenly seemed to be a magnet for female attention. It was amazing 
how a belief, when shifted, could create such a dramatic turnaround in my 
world.
Shortly thereafter, I met up with another beautiful woman, Kristina, 
whom I’d had a crush on for a long time. I’d known her for years as a friend 
and always considered her the dream woman. Beautiful, bold, highly intel -
ligent. And a redhead. I loved redheads.
But this time, with my new model of reality, I approached Kristina dif -
ferently. We started dating. Three years later, I proposed. Today, fifteen 
years later, we’re still together, with two wonderful kids.
Now I go on stage without feeling awkward. I go on camera without

fearing how I look. All because one girl 
I had great admiration for helped me 
turn around a long-held model of real-
ity. I had a lot more damaging beliefs 
to heal, but it was proof that with the 
right force, even entrenched childhood 
models of reality can be completely 
disrupted. And when it happens, the rewards can be amazing.
THE HYPNOTIST IN THE HOTEL ROOM
In 2015 I had an experience that helped me knock down another model of 
reality that was having an incredibly limiting impact on my life: I could not 
hold onto money. My business was doing well, but I was extremely uncom-
fortable taking ownership of the financial gains. My festival-like event, 
A-Fest, for example, was profitable, but I was giving away 100 percent of 
the profits to good causes without actually keeping anything as a reward. I 
was the coauthor of several personal development courses, but I’d never 
negotiated for the higher royalty I felt I deserved. This detachment from 
material wealth wasn’t a totally bad thing. But I also felt it had a downside, 
as it could limit the growth of my businesses and projects.
In 2015 I was wrapping up another great A-Fest, a festival I had founded 
in 2010, this time in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The event had just ended, and 
hundreds of participants were heading home. Walking into the restaurant 
overlooking the Adriatic Sea, I saw hypnotherapist Marisa Peer and her 
husband, British entrepreneur John Davy, having breakfast.
Marisa is an extraordinary individual who has helped people with seri -
ous problems have profound breakthroughs in personal growth very 
quickly. Marisa is one of the most powerful transformers of human belief 
systems I had ever come across; her work and her results are legendary. She 
counts the British royal family and a Who’s Who list of Hollywood celebs 
among her clientele.
Marisa’s speech at that A-Fest had commanded a standing ovation and 
was voted the best presentation of the event. In her speech, Marisa 
explained that the biggest ailment afflicting human beings is the idea of “I 
am not enough.” This childhood belief carries well into adulthood and 
becomes the root cause of a lot of our problems.
LESSON 2: We often carry 
disempowering models of reality 
that we inherited as far back as 
childhood.

As we had breakfast and discussed her work, I asked Marisa if she could 
hypnotize me. I’d never had hypnotherapy and was curious about the effects.
A few hours later, Marisa came to my hotel suite, and we talked about 
my goals for the session. My aim was this: I wanted to understand my atti-
tude about money. I wondered if it connected with some models of reality I 
might need to get rid of.
Marisa guided me into a regression, sifting through memories and 
images from my life. I felt as if I was drifting off into a light nap as she 
guided me with her voice. “Go back to a moment in your past when you 
first developed this belief,” she said.
Suddenly, I saw Mr. John, a teacher I’d had as a teenager. I adored him, 
and he was an incredible teacher. But while everyone in the class liked him, 
we all felt sorry for him. He always seemed so lonely. We knew his wife had 
left him. We knew he lived in a small apartment and didn’t have much 
money. But we loved him; we spent a lot of time talking about what a great 
guy he was and what a shame it was that he was in that situation.
“Can you see a thought pattern that you may have developed from this 
moment?” Marisa asked. And I realized that the Brule I’d internalized was:
To be a great teacher, you have to suffer.
I saw myself as a teacher because I run an education company and speak 
and write on personal growth. And I had an unconscious belief that I had 
to suffer in order to be a great teacher—which in my case manifested as 
having to be broke.
But Marisa didn’t stop there. She made me regress to another moment. 
I saw myself in the back seat of my parents’ car. It was my birthday. I was 
maybe nine or ten. My parents were driving me to a store to buy me a birth-
day gift. I was pretending to be asleep, but I could hear them talking in a 
worried way about money. At the time my parents were not wealthy, but 
they had enough. My mom was a public school teacher and my dad was a 
small entrepreneur. I remembered a feeling of guilt washing over me about 
my birthday gift. At the store, I picked out a book. “That’s all?” my mom 
asked. “You can pick out something more.” So I picked up a hockey stick. 
She said, “It’s your birthday. You can have more.” But I didn’t want to bur-
den my parents with any more expenses. That memory crystallized another 
model of reality I’d been carrying around:

72 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
Don’t ask for too much because someone will get hurt  
if you do.
We kept going. I regressed to another moment. I was sixteen, standing 
in the hot sun on a basketball court. The head of my school, a burly former 
weight lifter who, for whatever reason, seemed to despise me, even though 
I was a top student, was punishing me. That day, I’d forgotten my shorts for 
physical education class. He punished me for this small infraction by mak-
ing me stand in the sun for two hours. Then, because I didn’t seem afraid, 
he amped up the punishment by phoning my father in front of me and say-
ing to me, “You’re expelled from the school.” Then he walked away.
When my father arrived at the school, the headmaster told him, “I’m not 
really expelling your son. I’m just trying to scare him to teach him a les -
son.” My father was livid and confronted him about this extreme behavior 
in response to such a minor infraction.
I had tolerated being treated in this way.
“Now that you’re an adult, can you see why he did this to you?” Marisa 
asked. In my mind another Brule surfaced:
Do not stand out. It’s not safe to stand out.
I immediately saw how these three childhood models of reality were 
holding me back in numerous ways. My beliefs that it was dangerous to 
stand out, that being a good teacher meant not having wealth, and that I’d 
hurt or disappoint others if I asked for more, all were undermining me. I 
had never even realized I held those beliefs. When the beliefs were removed, 
massive changes occurred in my life.
What happened in the months afterward was incredible. Because my 
belief about standing out disappeared, I started speaking more. Almost 
immediately I got two major speaking engagements and my biggest speak -
ing payment yet. I got on camera more and hired my first PR firm. It seemed 
as if requests for interviews and appearances came out of nowhere. I made 
the cover of three magazines, was more active on social media, and saw 
massive rises in the number of followers I had on Facebook.
I also decided I wouldn’t be a suffering teacher anymore. I gave myself 
the first raise I’d had in five years.

The result? In just four months, I 
doubled my income. My business began 
to grow, too. We hit new revenue mile-
stones. It turned out that not only had 
my beliefs held me back but they had 
also been holding back my business 
and everyone who worked for me. 
These experiences proved to me how 
erasing old models of reality can have a profound impact on our lives.
THE MEANING-MAKING MACHINE  
IN YOUR HEAD
Most of us have our own versions of disempowering beliefs. Beliefs about 
the way we look, about our relationship with money, about our self-worth. 
These beliefs can come from unexpected sources: a bullying teacher, over -
hearing a conversation between parents or other authority figures, or the 
attention (or lack thereof) from people we’re attracted to.
As we believe these things to be true, they become true. All of us view 
the world through our own lens, colored by the experiences, meanings, and 
beliefs we’ve accumulated over the years.
It’s as if we have a meaning-making machine in our minds that kicks in 
and creates Brules about every experience we have. So, the kids tease me 
and call me names. This means I must be ugly. Never mind the fact that a 
more likely explanation is that those kids were simply being kids, and chil -
dren sometimes make fun of others. But as a kid I wasn’t mature enough to 
understand this, so instead I installed the model of reality that I was 
unattractive.
The meaning-making machine never sleeps. It runs during childhood 
and in adulthood, too: while on a date, dealing with your mate and your 
kids, interacting with your boss, trying to close a business deal, getting a 
raise (or not), and much more.
We add meanings to every situation we see and then carry these mean -
ings around as simplistic and often distorted and dangerous models of real-
ity about our world. We then act as if these models are laws. The experiences 
I’ve just described proved it to me personally, but scientists are beginning to 
LESSON 3: When you replace 
disempowering models of reality 
with empowering ones, 
tremendous changes can occur 
in your life at a very rapid pace.

study this phenomenon, and the results are astonishing. While the bad news 
is that our models of reality can cause stress, sadness, loneliness, and worry, 
the good news is that we can upgrade them. When we swap in optimized 
models that work better, we dramatically improve our lives.
Here are just a few of the amazing studies that speak to the power of our 
beliefs.
HOW OUR BELIEFS AFFECT OUR LOOKS 
AND OUR HEALTH
A simple suggestion can change what we think about ourselves and even 
our bodies, inside and out. In their report in Psychological Science on the 
famous study of the hotel maids, the researchers noted that just by being 
“told that the work they do (cleaning hotel rooms) is good exercise and 
satisfies the Surgeon General’s recommendations for an active lifestyle,” the 
women “perceived themselves to be getting significantly more exercise than 
before” and “showed a decrease in weight, blood pressure, body fat, waist-
to-hip ratio, and body mass index” compared to those who weren’t told 
this.
Weirder still, in a 1994 study, ten men with knee pain agreed to take 
part in a surgical procedure to relieve them of their pain. They were going 
to go through arthroscopic surgery—or so they thought. In reality, not all 
ten were going to actually receive the full surgery—instead, they were part 
of an intriguing experiment. J. Bruce Moseley, MD, was about to test an 
idea that the placebo effect so common with simple pills might actually 
extend to more serious conditions including those that required surgery. 
The men were going to be fully prepped for surgery, and they were going to 
leave the hospital with crutches and pain pills. But Dr. Moseley performed 
the full surgery on only two. On three others, he performed only one part 
of the procedure. On the knees of the remaining five, he made just three 
incisions so the patients would have the sight and sensation of incisions and 
then scars, but he performed no actual surgery. Even Dr. Moseley didn’t 
know which procedure each patient would receive until just before he per -
formed the surgery, so that he would not unconsciously tip off the patients 
in any way. When all ten men left the hospital, all of them believed  that 
they might have had the surgery to alleviate their condition.

Six months later, none of the men knew who had gotten the full surgery 
and who had gotten the sham. Yet all ten  said their pain was greatly 
reduced.
Imagine that! Marked improvement from a serious medical ailment for 
which surgery is performed—yet no surgery was performed.
The placebo effect, as it’s generally known, can be so powerful that all 
modern drugs have to be tested against a placebo before they are released 
to the public. According to Wired magazine, “half of all drugs that fail in 
late-stage trials drop out of the pipeline due to their inability to beat” pla -
cebos. Dr. Moseley’s work rocked the medical establishment by showing 
that the placebo effect could apply to ailments for which they were per -
forming surgery. Our beliefs about our bodies seem to have an uncanny 
impact on how we experience our bodies—for good or bad.
HOW OUR BELIEFS INFLUENCE OTHERS
If our beliefs can influence our bodies to such a dramatic degree, what else 
can they do? Can our beliefs influence the people around us?
The landmark studies by Robert Rosenthal, PhD, on the expectation 
effect prove just how much our lives are affected by other people’s models 
of reality, however true or false they might be. After discovering that even 
lab rats navigated mazes better or worse depending on the expectations of 
the researchers doing the training (the researchers were basically told that 
they had either smarter or dumber rats, when in fact all the rats were, well, 
just rats), Dr. Rosenthal took the inquiry into the classroom. First, he 
administered an IQ test to the students. Then teachers were told that five 
particular students had extra-high scores and were likely to outperform the 
others. In fact, the kids were randomly selected. But guess what? While the 
IQ of all of the kids had increased over the school year, those five had much 
better scores. The now-famous findings, published in 1968, were called the 
Pygmalion Effect, after the myth about Pygmalion, who fell in love with his 
sculpture of a gorgeous woman who came alive—much as the teachers’ 
expectations of those five students became reality.
Dr. Rosenthal and his colleagues spent the next thirty years verifying 
the effect and learning how it happens. It has also been found in business 
settings, the courtroom, and nursing homes. Bottom line: Your beliefs can

influence both you and the people around you. What you expect, you get.
We create models of reality about the behaviors of our spouses, lovers, 
bosses, employees, children—but as the research shows, our beliefs influ -
ence how others respond to us. How much of the irritating or negative 
characteristics you see in others is really a belief you’re projecting onto 
them?
This brings us to Law 4.
HEALTHIER MODELS FOR OURSELVES  
AND OUR CHILDREN
Each disempowering model of reality we have is really nothing more than 
a Brule we’ve set up for ourselves—and, like any Brule, it should be 
questioned.
The monk in the hot tub helped me see past a Brule that I had to keep 
proving myself to validate my own self-worth. Mary’s kiss shattered my 
Brule that I was unattractive to women. My session with Marisa shattered 
my Brules that only those who suffer make good teachers and that my visi-
bility and success could hurt me or others.
What’s the primary source of these Brules?
It’s got to do with how we were raised as children.
In Chapter 2, I quoted historian Yuval Noah Harari, PhD, who com -
pared children to molten glass when they’re born. Kids are incredibly mal-
leable, taking a huge number of beliefs onboard as they grow up and make 
meaning of the world around them. Under the age of nine, we’re particu -
larly susceptible to making false meanings and then clinging to them as 
disempowering models of reality.
While we work to clear our own limiting models, it’s crucial to also 
Law 4: Rewrite your models of reality.
Extraordinary minds have models of reality that empower them to feel good 
about themselves and powerful in shifting the world to match the visions in 
their minds.

make sure that we’re not saddling our children with models that are disem-
powering. Incidentally, the ideas below can be applied to interacting with 
adults, too. Remember, our meaning-making machine never turns off—it 
doesn’t stop just because we aren’t kids anymore. There are always oppor-
tunities to help others develop new beliefs and get rid of old, destructive 
ones.
How We Form Beliefs as Children
Author Shelly Lefkoe and her late husband, Morty—who passed away just 
as I was writing this book—developed an incredible understanding of how 
beliefs influence our lives. I once asked Shelly, “What’s the single biggest 
piece of advice you could give a parent?”
Shelly said this: “No matter what you do, in any situation with your 
child, ask yourself, What beliefs is my child going to take away from this 
encounter? Will your child walk away thinking: I just made a mistake and 
I learned something great  or I’m insignificant?”
There are many opportunities to practice this wise advice.
Suppose you’re at the dinner table with your kids and your son drops his 
fork on the floor. You might say, “Billy, don’t do that.” Now he throws his 
spoon on the ground. You say, “Billy, I TOLD YOU not to do that. You 
need to go stand in the corner for ten minutes and think about what you’ve 
done.”
Now, you might believe this is an okay way to handle things. You were 
calm. You simply sent Billy to a corner. But we’re losing the chance to influ-
ence the beliefs Billy might be developing from what’s happened. Remem -
ber to ask yourself: What are the beliefs my child is going to take away 
from this encounter?
Maybe Billy dropped his fork by accident, so when you reprimand him, 
he’s confused: Why doesn’t Mom trust me?
He drops the spoon to validate that belief, and sure enough, Mom gets 
angry and puts him in a corner. Now he forms a new belief: Mom doesn’t 
trust me, and I bother her . In the corner, Billy forms yet another belief: I 
am not worthy and I don’t have a right to speak my mind.
See how the meaning-making machine amps up?

78 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
Shelly’s advice is, at the end of any situation like that, ask your child, 
“Billy, what happened? What was the consequence? What can you learn 
from this?”
Shelly makes it very clear. Don’t ask Billy, “Why did you do that?” Why 
questions corner a child and put the child on the defensive. For one thing, 
the child is emotional, and even many adults can’t answer why in the grip 
of emotion. For another, it’s not appropriate to expect a young child to be 
psychologically savvy enough to dive into his own mind and accurately 
answer why he did what he did.
Instead, ask what questions: “Billy, what happened that made you drop 
that spoon?” This allows him to look within and think. He might answer, 
“I dropped it because I thought you weren’t listening to me.” What ques-
tions allow you to get to the root of the problem and work to heal it faster.
Shelly notes that why has to do with meaning, and meaning is always 
made up—a mental construct from the world of relative truth. Even if Billy 
did know why he dropped the spoon, it wouldn’t be empowering. Getting 
to the bottom of the situation itself—figuring out the what—allows you to 
work with your child to do something about it. Bottom line, Shelly suggests 
that when you walk away from an interaction with your child, ask yourself: 
What did my child just conclude about that interaction?  Did your child 
walk away thinking: I’m a winner or I’m a loser? I made a mistake and 
learned something new  or I’m an idiot?
Now, even if you’re not a parent, the idea here is quite profound. Imagine 
all the dangerous beliefs you may have taken on about the world even when 
the people around you were well-meaning, not to mention what happened 
when people’s intentions weren’t always the best.
NIGHTTIME EXERCISES TO REWIRE BELIEFS
Realizing just how much we absorb as children has made me extra careful 
about what I say to my kids. Over time I developed this simple hack to help 
remove negative beliefs in my children before they fester too long.
Every evening after work, I try to spend some time with my son, Hayden. 
We call this Dad and Hayden time. After playing with Legos or reading 
books, I tuck Hayden into bed. As I do so, I ask him two simple questions 
that I hope will end his day with positivity. First, I ask him to think of one

thing he was grateful for that day. It could be the soft sheets he’s sleeping 
on, a friend he played with, a conversation we had, or a book he read. I 
show him that he can be grateful for anything. Second, I ask, “Hayden, 
what did you love about yourself today?” I ask him to talk about something 
he did. Maybe it was an act of kindness—he helped another kid at school. 
Or a demonstration of intelligence—something he figured out or something 
smart that he said. Maybe it was being helpful—the way he took care of his 
baby sister. If he can’t think of anything, then I tell him something I love 
about him. As we play before bedtime, I try to notice little things about him. 
As I tuck him in, I tell him what I saw. Last week it was, “I love the ques -
tions you ask about science. I think you have a great mind for solving prob-
lems.” If you can do this for your children, you end up raising children who 
are far more resistant to Brules, because inside, they are a lot more secure.
Instilling this habit into Hayden’s life is my way of trying to keep his 
models of reality clear of Brules before they form—but it’s never too late to 
start. I encourage you to integrate these exercises into your own evening 
routine so that you, too, will have a way of rooting out any damaging mod-
els of reality before they take hold. These two exercises work just as well for 
adults as they do for kids. Try it on your kids—or yourself—each night 
before going to bed.
Exercise: The Gratitude Exercise
Take a few minutes and think of three to five things you’re grateful for 
today:
 ■ Perhaps it’s how the sun felt on your face when you left the house this 
morning.
 ■ Or the music you listened to on your way to work.
 ■ Was it the smile and thank you that you exchanged with a store clerk?
 ■ Or a laugh you shared with some people at work?
 ■ Maybe it was that special look your partner, best friend, child, or pet 
gave you.
 ■ Or the good workout tips you got from the trainer at the gym.
 ■ Or was it just how great it feels to get home, kick off your shoes, and 
call it a day?

Exercise: The “What I Love  
about Myself” Exercise
Think about a quality or an action of yours that made you proud today. 
Maybe nobody else told you that they appreciated it, but it’s time that you 
affirmed it for yourself. Think about what it is about you as a human being 
that you can love. Is it your unique style? Did you solve a complex problem 
at work? Is it your way with animals? Your dance moves? Your jump shot? 
That awesome meal you cooked last night? The fact that you know the 
lyrics to every Disney song since The Little Mermaid ? You can identify 
qualities that are big or small, but you must pinpoint three to five things 
every day that make you proud to be who you are.
You can practice this simple self-affirmation in the morning when wak -
ing up or just before going to sleep. For me, it’s helped me heal much of 
what the monk in the hot tub pointed out to me.
Marisa Peer suggests that all of us have a child within who never 
received all the love and appreciation we deserved. We can’t go back and fix 
the past. But we can take responsibility to heal ourselves now by giving 
ourselves the love and appreciation we once craved. You can help heal your 
own inner child.
EXTERNAL MODELS OF REALITY
Thus far we’ve looked at internal models of reality, models that apply to 
how we perceive ourselves. But external models of reality are just as pow -
erful in our lives. Your external models of reality are the beliefs you have 
about the world around you.
Below are four of the most powerful new models I’ve decided to believe 
are true about the world.
I came to accept these four models as I went through life. They replaced 
older, less evolved models and added immense value to my life. Read with 
an open mind.
1. We all possess human intuition.
This model of reality replaced an earlier model that all “knowing” comes 
purely from hard facts and data. Today I strongly believe in intuition and 
043-110_152510_CEM_P2.indd   80 3/4/16   12:33 PM

use it in my daily life. It helps me make better decisions, know whom to 
hire, and even helps me with creative pursuits like writing this book. 
Remember how my phone sales career took off when I used intuition as 
part of my selling strategy? Human beings can function as logical beings 
and as intuitive beings. When we use both capabilities, we’re priming our -
selves for extraordinary results.
Science is finding that we operate on two levels. One is what we might 
call instinct, which runs below rational awareness. It’s connected with pre-
historic brain areas and is lightning fast. The other is the rational side that 
evolved later, but on which we rely heavily in our lives today.
In one study, scientists gave participants two decks of cards and told 
them they were going to play a card game for money. Unbeknownst to the 
players, both decks were stacked: one like a roller-coaster ride—major 
wins, major losses; the other a smoother ride—few losses, small wins. After 
drawing fifty cards or so, players suspected one deck promised a smoother 
ride. By eighty cards or so, they had the whole ruse figured out. But here’s 
the thing: Their sweat glands knew something was up after just ten cards. 
Yup, these glands on the players’ palms opened up a little with every reach 
toward the roller-coaster deck. Not only that, but at about the same time, 
the players began reaching more often for the smoother-ride deck without 
even realizing it! Their intuitive selves recognized and somehow drew them 
to the safer choice.
I believe human intuition is real, and with practice we can get better at 
tuning into it for decision making. I do not believe you can foretell the 
future, but I do believe in gut instinct in decision making. I try to listen to 
my gut on a daily basis. See what happens when you try to do the same.
2. There is power in mind-body healing.
Earlier I talked about the terrible acne I had as a teenager. With little social 
life to speak of, I spent a lot of time reading. One thing I read about was 
creative visualization. Creative visualization is a practice of shifting beliefs 
by meditating and then visualizing your life as you want it to evolve. It’s 
based on the idea that the subconscious mind cannot differentiate between 
a real and imagined experience. So I started visualizing my skin getting 
better. I spent just five minutes, three times a day visualizing my skin under-
going healing. I used imagery that felt powerful to me: looking at the sky,

reaching out and scooping up some of that radiant blueness, and smoothing 
it on my face. I saw the blue hardening and then saw it being pulled off, 
taking the dead skin with it, leaving glowing new skin beneath. Essentially 
this process trains the subconscious mind to develop a new belief—in my 
case, my skin is becoming beautiful .
In one month of practicing this technique three times a day for five min-
utes per session, I ended my acne problem. Mind-body healing involves the 
conscious practice of certain mindfulness or visualization techniques to 
heal certain aspects of yourself. I’d had acne for five years and seen many 
doctors, to little avail. Using creative visualization, I healed my skin in four 
weeks—giving myself a huge boost of confidence and self-worth.
For those of you who’d like to try this practice, I’ve recorded a video 
explaining how I worked with creative visualization. I also explain the 
exact method I used to heal my skin. You can download it as part of the 
free resources on www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
3. Happiness at work is the new productivity.
Most of us are told to work hard. Few of us are encouraged to work happy. 
In the developed world, we spend close to 70 percent of our waking hours 
at work—but according to multiple studies, close to 50 percent of us dislike 
our jobs. That’s an unfortunate situation for billions of people today. Unless 
we’re passionate about some aspect of our work, a big part of life will feel 
unsatisfying.
Work, I believe, should be something that inspires you to jump out of 
bed each morning. From the start at Mindvalley, we embraced the idea that 
“happiness is the new productivity.” Our unique work culture is designed 
to ensure that while employees get things done, we have immense fun doing 
it. We do this through various models and systems designed to boost hap -
piness. These include investing in beautiful, inspiring office design, offering 
flexible working hours, hosting annual team retreats to paradise islands if 
we hit our goals, and almost weekly social gatherings and parties to foster 
friendship and connection.
This culture of happiness at work significantly helps reduce the immense

stress of racing to build a fast-growing company. It’s helped me keep my 
sanity while working long hours to hit our goals. It’s possible to bring a 
culture of happiness to any work environment. Whether you’re a CEO or a 
freelancer, an assistant or a manager, it is critically important that you find 
a way to enjoy your work. Have lunch with someone from your office or 
someone in your business network once a week, even once a month. Pay 
someone a compliment about his or her work every day. Or take Richard 
Branson’s advice. He said: “I have always believed that the benefits of let -
ting your staff have the occasional blast at an after-hours get-together is a 
hugely important ingredient in the mix that makes for a family atmosphere 
and a fun-loving, free-spirited corporate culture. It also goes a long way to 
tearing down any semblance of hierarchy when you’ve seen the CFO doing 
the limbo with a bottle of beer in her hand.”
In short, happiness and work need to go hand in hand.
Want to learn more about my models for bringing happiness to work? 
I’ve given several detailed talks on my methods for injecting happiness 
at work to fuel a company’s productivity. You can watch a short TEDx 
talk or a longer 90-minute training session with information on how to 
apply these models to your company or business. Both are available on 
www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
4. It is possible to be spiritual but not religious.
The traditional model of reality goes like this: I can only be spiritual if I 
follow a particular religion. But why not consider that our spiritual self 
exists apart from religious systems, and that morality is not dependent on 
religion or belief in God?
Goodness, kindness, and the Golden Rule do not just have to be taught 
via religion. According to the book Good without God by Greg M. Epstein, 
the humanist chaplain at Harvard University, the fourth biggest life adher -
ence in the world today after Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism is now 
humanism. Humanism is the idea that we do not need religion in order to 
be good. It differs from atheism in the sense that humanists believe that 
there is a “God,” but He’s certainly not the judgmental, angry being that

84 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
many religious texts make Him out to be. Instead, to a humanist, “God” 
might be the universe, or the connectedness of life on Earth, or spirit. 
Humanism is opening up a new spiritual path for people who want to reject 
the Brules of religion but who don’t embrace atheism. One billion human-
ists now exist on the planet, and their numbers are growing.
In addition to exploring humanism, you could also try to craft your own 
religion—rich in tradition and self-discovered experiences, but free of the 
Brules of organized religion. In the book A Religion of One’s Own  by 
Thomas Moore, the author suggests that we should all create our own reli-
gion. He writes:
This new kind of religion asks that you move away from being a 
follower to being a creator. I foresee a new kind of spiritual creativ -
ity, in which we no longer decide whether to believe in a given creed 
and follow a certain tradition blindly. Now we allow ourselves a 
healthy and even pious skepticism. Most important, we no longer feel 
pressure to choose one tradition over another but rather are able to 
appreciate many routes to spiritual richness. This new religion is a 
blend of individual inspiration and inspiring tradition.
Personally, I struggled when I left religion. I believed in a higher power, 
so pure atheism did not feel right to me. Then I started exploring models 
such as humanism and pantheism and found my answer. Today I combine 
ideas from humanism, pantheism, and spiritual practices like meditation 
with my family’s own beliefs from Hinduism and Christianity, which I pick 
and choose depending on how empowering these models feel.
Exercise: Examining Your Models of Reality  
in the Twelve Areas of Balance
Below is a list of the Twelve Areas of Balance from the previous chapter. On 
your computer or in your journal, write down the models of reality that you 
have in each of these categories. I’ve listed a few common ones to get you 
started. You should notice a correlation with your results from rating these 
categories in Chapter 3; in other words, the categories where you assigned 
the lowest rating may also have the most disempowering models of belief.

TWO TOOLS TO REWRITE  
YOUR MODELS OF REALITY
After doing the exercise above, you should have some idea of the models of 
reality you need to upgrade. You don’t need to meet with monks in hot tubs 
or get hypnotherapy to upgrade your models. (Though wouldn’t it be nice

if we could all get an instant upgrade with a kiss?) Bad models can evapo -
rate through sudden realizations—sometimes spontaneous ones (such as I 
had in the hot tub)—or through meditation, inspirational reading, or other 
mindfulness practices, including just sitting in a room by yourself, reflect -
ing on your life, and asking yourself, Where did I come up with this par -
ticular world view?
As you progress through this book, you’ll gain insights and experience 
“ah-hahs” that will open you up for letting go of certain disempowering 
models. There will also be specific exercises that will help you shed models 
through the awakening these exercises will bring. For now, though, here are 
two instant techniques you can apply to remove negative models of reality 
that you might develop on a day-to-day basis. Both are based on the idea of 
activating your rational mind before you unconsciously adopt a model.
Question 1: Is my model of reality  
absolute or relative truth?
While some things in the world are absolute truths (they hold true for all 
human beings across every culture—such as the idea that parents must take 
care of their children when children can’t take care of themselves, or that 
we all need to eat in order to survive), many things are only relative truth: 
They’re done differently by different cultures, such as particular ways of 
parenting, eating, spiritual expression, handling a love relationship, and 
much more.
Is your model of reality absolute truth or relative truth? If you have a 
model that isn’t scientifically validated, feel free to challenge it. This is cer-
tainly true of religious beliefs. One reason why as a kid I questioned my 
culture’s rules on eating beef was that I noticed that millions of people all 
around the world could enjoy eating beef. Why couldn’t I?
Is there an aspect of your culture you know is relative truth for the 
greater part of humanity? If you still enjoy believing it, do so. But if it’s 
harmful or results in your having to dress in a certain way, marry in a cer-
tain way, or restrict your diet or life in a way you dislike, you owe it to 
yourself to abandon it. Brules are made to be broken.
Remember that no single culture or religion dominates the majority of 
the planet today. No major religion holds sway over the majority of the

human population. Know that whatever your culture trained you to believe, 
the vast majority of human beings probably do not believe. And you can 
choose to disbelieve, too. The power to choose what we want to believe and 
what we want to disbelieve is one of the greatest gifts we can give 
ourselves.
The best advice is often to listen to your heart and intuition. Remember 
that our models of reality all have expiration dates. Even what we take to 
be absolute truth today may not always be a truth in the future. This ques -
tion is wonderful for situations where our models are indoctrinated through 
our culture and society. But it’s important to understand that we ourselves 
also create models of reality via our meaning-making machine. That’s 
where Question 2 comes in.
Question 2: Does this really mean  
what I think it means?
Morty and Shelly Lefkoe have an interesting model for hacking beliefs that 
has to do with turning off your mind’s meaning-making machine. Accord-
ing to Morty, we can manufacture as many as 500 different “meanings” a 
week. But as we learn to ask ourselves, Is this really true? Am I 100 percent 
sure that this is what’s really going on?—we start to reduce the number of 
meanings.
Morty says it’s easy to get from 500 to 200 a week if you just do an 
internal inventory at regular intervals to check whether you’re creating 
meaning where none should exist. Then it’s just about practice. Eventually 
you stop adding meaning to events. You will become less reactive to stress 
and less upset with others in your life. It helps your marriage, and I can tell 
you it will help your relationships with your boss and coworkers. As a CEO 
leading a team of 200 people, I’ve consistently found that those who had 
their meaning-making machines under control at work were more effective 
leaders.
I recorded a longer conversation with Morty on his Lefkoe belief pro -
cess. This video is very personal to me as it was the last training Morty 
Lefkoe ever gave before he passed away in November 2015. I feel it is my 
duty to share his final words of wisdom with you. You can watch the full 
experience at www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.

I believe the best thing we can do with outdated models of reality is to 
let them go gracefully. Turn them into history. Let’s celebrate our extraor-
dinary ability to evolve emotionally, mentally, spiritually throughout life, 
taking on new ideas, thoughts, philosophies, and ways of being and living. 
When enough people challenge the Brules and adopt optimal models, you 
have evolutionary progress of the human race. And when enough people 
optimize their models all at the same time, you have revolutionary change 
that acts like a slingshot to hurl us to a new order, powered by the impetus 
of our collective awakening.
True brilliance is not a function of understanding one’s view 
of the world and finding order, logic, and spirituality in it. 
True brilliance is understanding that your view of order, logic, 
and spirituality is what created your world and therefore 
being forever capable of changing everything.
—MIKE DOOLEY
Now that you’ve taken a closer look at how models of reality take root 
and identified some of the key models of reality in your life, it’s time to 
connect those insights with the next step in consciousness engineering. In 
the next chapter, you’ll discover how your everyday life—your systems for 
living—dovetails with your models and learn how to optimize your systems 
to set the stage for extraordinary growth in all areas of your life.

Where We Discover How to Get Better at  
Life by Constantly Updating Our Daily Systems
I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where 
you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how 
you could be doing it better. I think that’s the single best 
piece of advice: Constantly think about how you could be 
doing things better and questioning yourself.
— ELON MUSK
RICHARD BRANSON’S SECRET SYSTEM
It was a starry evening on Necker Island, the private island owned by Rich-
ard Branson, and the beach party had wound down to that lazy lull where 
you’re totally relaxed, sitting there gazing at the stars, and soaking in the 
beauty all around you. It was my second trip to Branson’s beautiful home 
on Necker Island. I was there with a group of entrepreneurs for a four-day 
mastermind and adventure trip.
In the quiet, I had a chance to sit with Richard for a while and talk one-
on-one about all sorts of things, from life to parenting to personal philoso -
phy. My wife and I were struggling to conceive our second child but had 
failed for four straight years. Richard was actually giving me advice on 
what I could do to improve my odds of being a father again. (Getting pro -
creation advice from Branson will always be an interesting memory for me.) 
It was impressive to see how much he cared and how genuine he was.

92 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
That’s when it occurred to me that, given that I was sitting in private 
conversation with one of the world’s greatest entrepreneurs, maybe I should 
stop discussing ways to improve sperm count and instead ask Richard for 
something a bit more related to his genius zone. So I asked him this: “Rich-
ard, you’ve started eight different companies in eight different industries 
and taken all of them to a billion dollars. That’s huge. If you could summa-
rize in one sentence how you did it, what would you say?”
Richard didn’t blink. He answered immediately like a wise, kind sage. 
Here’s what he said:
It’s all about finding and hiring people smarter than you, getting 
them to join your business and giving them good work, then getting 
out of the way and trusting them. You have to get out of the way so 
you can focus on the bigger vision. That’s important, but here is the 
main thing: You must make them see their work as a mission.
This, in Richard’s words, is his “system” for starting game-changing 
companies. His focus is on hiring smart people, giving them freedom and 
getting out of the way, and continuously thinking of the vision, ensuring 
that a mission was driving the company.
A system for living is a repeated, optimized pattern for getting things 
done. How we dress in the morning is a system. How we get through our 
e-mail is often a system. Our work, our parenting, our exercise routine, 
how we make love and handle relationships, our methods for creativity—all 
often fall into specific systems for living.
I compare systems for living to the software that computers use to per -
form specific operations. They’re the things you do to function in the world, 
from the moment you wake up to your nighttime rituals like putting on 
your pajamas and reading a book before going to bed. We have societal 
systems, too, such as our educational system, business structures, and com-
munity systems.
Where do our systems come from? As you know from Chapter 3, they 
come from our beliefs about what’s true, right, good, healthy, necessary, 
appropriate, and effective. After our models of reality, they’re the second 
aspect of consciousness engineering that allows you to advance your human 
potential and step into the extraordinary.

But here’s the problem. Most of us are using systems that have long 
become obsolete. As Bill Jensen said in his book Future Strong:  “Even as 
we enter one of the most disruptive eras in human history, one of the big -
gest challenges we face is that today’s systems and structures still live on, 
past their expiration dates. We are locked into twentieth-century 
approaches that are holding back the next big fundamental shifts in 
human capacity.”
UPGRADED SYSTEMS FOR AN UPGRADED LIFE
Good software is constantly being updated. It would be ridiculous to still 
be running Windows 95 when you could be running the latest version. Yet 
when it comes to our systems for living—our internal software—we run 
systems that are highly suboptimal.
But what if you start viewing your systems for living in much the same 
way you view the apps you download on your smartphone? When you swap 
outdated models of reality for empowering ones and pair them with new 
systems for applying your new models day to day, your life will improve 
exponentially—and fast.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to think about your systems for living 
in a very structured way so that you get to do more and create more, in less 
time, while having more fun.
Let me give you an example related to that night on Necker Island with 
Richard Branson.
I had been thinking about writing a book for a long time but had no 
idea how to start. I simply was not ready.
I wanted to write in a style that contained practical lessons scattered 
among fascinating stories that could keep the reader entertained. One of my 
favorite books of this type was actually Branson’s 1998 autobiography Los-
ing My Virginity . I loved it because of the personal stories peppered with 
really powerful personal growth lessons. That book became one of the role 
model books for the kind of book I wanted to write.
However, I was nowhere close to Branson in terms of life accomplishments 
or life adventures. So I stayed stuck—thinking I’d “someday” write such a 
book when I could prove myself by getting my business to a gigantic level.
That same night on Necker as we were talking about parenting and I

shared with Branson some of my philosophies, he interrupted me and said, 
“You should write a book.”
I was silent, stunned. That little push from Branson (and he probably 
doesn’t even remember it) was just the boost of confidence I needed to start 
seriously thinking about this book.
Still it took me three years to figure out what I wanted to write about.
Then it took me one whole year to get a framework done.
And then it took me three months to write the first chapter.
It was slow and painful.
But each day, I kept optimizing my systems.
I developed a method for coming up with titles, a method for creating a 
framework, and a style for writing personal stories. I even tested different 
types of whiskey to see which helped me create the most interesting writing. 
(Scotch versus Kentucky versus Japanese. If you must know, Jim Beam Ken-
tucky bourbon won.)
As I fine-tuned these systems, I experienced exponential productivity in 
my writing abilities. Now, I can write a chapter in a single day. Three 
months ago, this would have been next to impossible. Here’s my efficiency 
plotted on the graph below that shows how far I came as I optimized the 
system. Note how hard it was to start but how much I could speed up as I 
formalized my system.

When you optimize your systems for living, you can experience expo -
nential growth in areas that truly matter to you.
EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE DISCOVER 
EXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS
Extraordinary people don’t just have extraordinary models of reality. They 
strive to ensure that their systems for living—that is, DOING what they do 
in the world—are well defined, structured, and continuously optimized.
I try to upgrade at least one of my systems for living every week, not 
because I feel like things are always broken but because I know how ener -
gizing it is to try something new. It’s exciting to think that we can just swap 
in a new system like downloading a new app.
There’s a three-step method for effectively upgrading your systems for 
living:
1. THE DISCOVERY PROCESS. Many people discover new systems from 
books, conferences, or online courses. Maybe you read about the benefits of 
a particular approach to weight training. You do some research and decide to 
incorporate it into your workouts. In a month or two, you assess the results. 
Or you hear about a new management strategy at a conference and decide to 
try it with your team and track how it’s working. I make it a habit to read 
nonfiction books on a wide variety of topics that matter to me, such as par-
enting, work, and exercise, and to continually discover new systems. Think 
of it like browsing the App Store. It can be fun and enlightening when you 
find something that seems to work for others and might also work for you.
2. YOUR REFRESH RATE. Your refresh rate is how often you upgrade 
your systems for living. For example, I try to experiment with a new exer -
cise system every year. In 2013, for example, I spent thirty days straight on 
Les Mills’s BODYPUMP. The next year I experimented with Minimum 
Effective Dose exercises such as Christine Bullock’s Total Transformation 
program. This year I’m trying kettlebells. None of these was randomly 
chosen. I discovered them after reading books, having conversations with 
friends who were passionate about fitness, and knowing what my needs 
were (love handles begone!). I made these changes not necessarily because 
my previous exercise system was broken but because I simply realized I’m

more likely to work out if I switch things up regularly so I don’t get bored. 
It also ensures that I’m working different muscle groups and keeping my 
whole body fit and healthy.
3. SET POINTS AND MEASUREMENT. How effective are your systems 
for living? Is your new system for living really better than a previous one? 
We’ll look at ways to measure and maintain the effectiveness of your sys -
tems for living as you discover and refresh them. This is the important bit 
that people often forget—are you measuring the effectiveness of your sys -
tem? A set point is a level of performance that you do not allow yourself to 
slip below. For example, I have a waist measurement set point that has kept 
me at the same waist size for ten years. I measure it by seeing which hole is 
used when buckling my favorite belt. If I ever go even slightly beyond that 
set point, I make it a discipline to diet or exercise to get back to my set 
point. I’m not allowed to buy a new belt.
Here’s how all three stages come together to allow you to create effective 
systems for governing your life.
The Discovery Process
Patrick Grove is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Australia and the 
Asia Pacific region. His entrepreneurial success has made him a member of the 
Business Review Australia’s Rich 200 list, and he’s known as the Asia Pacific’s 
IPO whiz kid because he holds the seemingly incredible record of starting four 
companies and taking each of them public. He’s also a close friend. I once 
bumped into Patrick in a local Starbucks in the neighborhood where we live, 
where I found him scribbling furiously on a piece of paper. When I asked what 
he was up to, he said, “I’m trying to solve this massive problem.”
“What is it?” I asked.
“I’m trying to figure out how I can make $100 million in one year,” he 
answered.
I smiled. But I knew Patrick was serious. He’s one of the biggest thinkers 
I know. Making $100 million in one year sounds impossible to most people, 
but to an extraordinary mind like Patrick’s, it’s a reasonable question. It 
was not a function of “is it possible?” but rather “when is it possible?”
That encounter happened in 2008. In 2013 Patrick pulled it off. He 
acquired three small used car websites across Southeast Asia, renamed the

group iCar Asia, took it public in Australia, and drove this investment to 
over $100 million in valuation. All in ONE year.
Patrick likes to get out of the office and ask himself big, tough questions, 
and then he says that the inspiration for his business ideas often comes to 
him. He makes sure that he gives himself the space and time to do this. Too 
many of us are so busy doing that we never step back and think about how 
we’re doing. Or why we’re doing it. I call this the do-do trap. You’re so busy 
doing what needs to be done, you don’t really know whether your systems 
for living might be obsolete, or even (pun intended) absolute crap.
This is why people like Patrick get out of the office and find the time and 
space to question their systems and set new, bolder goals.
Awareness is the essence of discovery. Every now and then, stop doing 
and gather some research. I know many people who have a disciplined sys-
tem for going to the gym a few times weekly. But are your gym workouts 
fully optimized? For example, once a month I might actually skip going to 
the gym one day and instead read about new workout routines, buy a new 
fitness app, or study a new fitness method to optimize my gym time. This 
is what I mean by the discovery process. You step back from what you’re 
doing and seek to discover new ways to do it better.
At Mindvalley we bypass the do-do trap through a technique called 
Learn Day. On the first Friday of every month, nobody works (unless it’s 
something crucial). Instead, everyone focuses on learning about how to 
work better. Customer support agents may research the art of writing per -
sonalized replies or review customer feedback for ideas on improving our 
products. A programmer may experiment with a new coding language. Peo-
ple are allowed to sit and read all day, provided it’s a book related to their 
career. Through this process, new ideas form, new systems emerge, and 
new ways of working are born.
Whether related to work, health, fitness, personal growth, culture, or 
anything else, discovery is a life-affirming tool. It’s not just about making 
life a little more interesting. It allows you to be better at what you want to 
do. Patrick Grove is the chairman of four public companies, and he still has 
time to step back and rethink his systems. Some might say that this is  why 
he’s chairman of four public companies. Surely all of us can find the time 
to think in a different way about how to solve our own problems—massive 
or otherwise.

Your Refresh Rate
When was the last time you read a book about a topic you were interested 
in but knew nothing about? Signed up for a class? Sought honest feedback 
from a friend? Sat in a Starbucks and scribbled notes about crazy dreams 
you wanted to pursue? Or otherwise revitalized the systems in your life? 
Keeping your systems fresh is a system in itself. Your frequency of doing 
this is your refresh rate.
Exercise: What’s Your Refresh Rate?
Let’s go back to the Twelve Areas of Balance we looked at in Chapter 3. 
Have you updated the systems in any of these parts of your life recently? If 
not, it’s time to hit the refresh button.
Write down the areas where you know you need to make some changes. 
It could be how you interact with your partner, the way you raise your kids, 
how you deal with people and projects at work, how you’re pursuing a job 
hunt, whether your home and other creature comforts make you feel good, 
or whether you’re making time for big dreams, amazing new experiences, 
spiritual insights, or creative growth. Maybe you want tune-ups in all of 
these areas. You’ll get there.
The important thing is to remember to study and invest in learning about 
how to improve your systems for living. Below are the twelve categories; for 
each, I’ve added my personal favorite book as a suggestion for something that 
might give you a bold new perspective on the subject:
1. YOUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP. Men Are from Mars, Women Are 
from Venus by John Gray. This book is a beautiful and somewhat 
humorous look at how to live with and love the opposite sex.
2. YOUR FRIENDSHIPS. How to Win Friends and Influence People  by 
Dale Carnegie. I read this book seven times before I turned twenty; 
an amazing book for anyone.
3. YOUR ADVENTURES. Losing My Virginity by Richard Branson. 
This book inspires you to live a life of adventure and to have fun 
while pursuing big goals.
4. YOUR ENVIRONMENT. The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. 
Schwartz, PhD. This book inspires you to upgrade your quality of 
life and to dream bigger about your home, your office space, the 
car you drive, and more.

5. YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS. Here I have different 
recommendations for men or women. For men, it’s The 
Bulletproof Diet  by Dave Asprey. Dave is a friend and the most 
famous biohacker in the world. This is science meets eating. For 
women, it’s The Virgin Diet  by JJ Virgin, which will challenge 
your rules about calories and exercise and show you that it’s not 
about how much you eat, but how you combine the right foods in 
the right order for your body’s “chemistry lab.”
6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL LIFE. What better way to optimize your 
intellectual life than by upgrading your learning systems, learning 
to speed-learn and improve your memory? I recommend courses by 
Jim Kwik.
7. YOUR SKILLS. The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss is a great 
book on finding fast hacks to developing unique skills.
8. YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE. Conversations with God  by Neale Donald 
Walsch is the best book I’ve read on spiritual growth. But a close 
tie is Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, which 
was Steve Jobs’s favorite book.
9. YOUR CAREER. Originals by Adam Grant is one of the best books 
I’ve read on how to be more creative at work and how to think 
outside the box, sell your ideas, and make a difference.
10. YOUR CREATIVE LIFE. The War of Art by Steven Pressfield inspires 
you to shed your artist inertia and get moving with your creative work. 
It is also one of the most beautifully written books I’ve come across.
11. YOUR FAMILY LIFE. I believe the root cause of most family issues is 
the lack of self-love, so I suggest The Mastery of Love by Don 
Miguel Ruiz.
12. YOUR COMMUNITY LIFE. Delivering Happiness  by Zappos CEO 
Tony Hsieh is an inspirational read on starting epic businesses and 
giving back to the world in a big way.
Want to jump-start your progress? Aim to read one book a week. If you 
find this hard, start by first learning to speed-read. (You’re upgrading your 
reading system.) With a few simple tricks, you can rapidly boost your read-
ing speed.

100 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
Reading is an easy and excellent way to boost your refresh rate. But you 
should also consider online courses, masterminds, networking groups, and 
seminars. Patrick Grove is a learning junkie. We became friends because of our 
mutual interest in personal growth and the seminars and courses we attend.
My visit to Necker Island was part of a learning experience, too. I was 
there to bond, connect, and share ideas with other entrepreneurs looking to 
build big businesses while having daily sessions with Branson, who served 
as a mentor to us. The reason I founded MindvalleyAcademy.com, which at 
the time of this writing has more than a million members, was to provide 
people with the opportunity to learn new models and systems from the 
world’s greatest teachers. These teachers teach and run webinars in the 
academy, many of which are completely free to attend.
The more you seek opportunities to learn and then apply your learnings, 
the faster your refresh rate.
Set Points and Measurement
It’s great to refresh your systems for living. But once you’ve got a good thing 
going, how do you maintain it?
You know what it feels like to set out to make a big life improvement, 
only to see your results slip away a little bit at a time. You work hard to 
take off the pounds; then they start to creep back. You fall back into your 
procrastination habit. You spend more and save less. Or you stop keeping 
up with friends, or with your meditation practice, or connecting with your 
kids, or snuggling so much with your sweetheart.
I struggle with this as much as anyone. But I’ve figured out a way to 
reset myself when my systems start to slip. I devised a tool called non-  
negotiable set points.
Here’s an example of how I apply this in my life.
I love my wine, whiskey, chocolate, and cheese. But I like to stay in shape 
because I feel and perform at my best when I’m at peak physical energy.
As I get older, I’ve been setting up simple mental and physical hacks to 
slow down my aging and maintain my sense of well-being. My non-  
negotiable set point for my body is that at any time, I should be able to drop 
and do fifty push-ups. No excuses. I can come off a twenty-hour flight from 
L.A. to Kuala Lumpur and plop into bed at home. But after a good sleep if 
I get out of bed and can’t do fifty—something’s off. Fifty push-ups is my 
043-110_152510_CEM_P2.indd   100 3/4/16   12:33 PM

health pulse check. I can always tell when my travel schedule or a few good 
meals with family and friends has nudged me off my peak, because I have 
a hard time doing my usual fifty push-ups during my workout. If that hap -
pens, I know that I need to really pay attention to how I’m treating my body 
and make some changes.
We can establish these system checks for our finances, the time we spend 
with our kids, our endurance, the number of books we read per week, and 
so on.
Things slip when we don’t have a detection method for knowing when 
it’s happening. Set points are that detection method.
Exercise: Your Non-Negotiable Set Points
A set point is simply a bare-minimum threshold you establish for yourself 
that you promise you will not go below. A set point differs from a goal. 
Goals pull you forward, while set points help you maintain what you have. 
You need both.
You can establish set points for anything important to you. And here’s a 
secret: You can use set points not only to prevent or reverse slipping but also 
to improve over time. Imagine getting fitter as you get older . . . more intimate 
with your partner  . . . more secure financially  . . . or closer to your kids. 
There’s a super-simple set point mind trick you can deploy that ups your game 
in amazing ways. So, let’s get you started on setting up your own set points.
Step 1: Identify the areas of your life where you want to 
create set points.
Look back at the Twelve Areas of Balance list from Chapter 3. In which 
categories did you score the lowest? Where are you slipping? Pick two or 
three to focus on, for which you’d like to set specific, achievable set points. 
Eventually, you can expand your list, but start with a few that are really 
important to you.
Step 2: Determine your set points.
Next, create set point targets for each area you’ve selected. Now, this is 
very important: Make sure that your set points are absolutely achievable . 
You’ll see why in a minute.
For things you can measure (your weight or your bank account, for 
example), you can establish specific amounts: My weight set point is X. My 
043-110_152510_CEM_P2.indd   101 3/4/16   12:33 PM

102 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
bank account set point is Y. You can establish set points for your intellec -
tual life (I will read X books per month) or even your work (I will spend 
two hours a week researching or studying something that will make me 
better at my job). The more specific you are, the easier it will be to keep 
track of the set point and actually stick with it.
Here is an example of potential set points you can choose for each of the 
Twelve Areas of Balance:
1. YOUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP. Set up set points for how much time 
you spend together, whether it’s the frequency of date nights, 
working out together, or even regularly scheduled lovemaking.
2. YOUR FRIENDSHIPS. Create set points for keeping in touch; for 
example, calling a close friend at least once a week, inviting friends 
for brunch or dinner once a month, writing a short weekly note to 
someone going through a tough time.
3. YOUR ADVENTURES. Consider setting set points for the frequency 
of holidays or adventure trips. I go on at least two long trips with 
my entire family every year. We don’t have to be going somewhere 
exotic or expensive, but by committing to extended time with my 
family, I have a chance to show them how much I love them while 
we create lasting memories together. You could commit to going to 
one new place every month, even if that place is somewhere in your 
neighborhood. It doesn’t have to cost any money at all, but your 
world will feel bigger and brighter when you regularly expose 
yourself to new corners of it.
4. YOUR ENVIRONMENT. Set a few simple set points for keeping 
your home tidy; for example, making the bed every morning, 
making sure the sink is clear of dirty dishes at night, sorting the 
mail as soon as you get it and recycling what you don’t need to 
keep, and so on. You can also create set points for the level of 
quality of your life; for example, a weekly full-body massage or 
spa treatment.
5. YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS. Set some specific set points as 
fitness benchmarks. For me, it’s my push-up routine. It could also 
be maintaining a specific waist measurement or getting in the

routine of going to one yoga or Pilates class per week, or even 
tracking your eyesight or blood pressure.
6. YOUR INTELLE CTUAL LIFE. Start to incorporate some systems 
for bringing intellectual richness into your life. It might be 
reading a few pages each night before bed, visiting a gallery or 
exploring one room of a museum each week, or attending one 
play per month. A great set point here is to read at least two 
books per month.
7. YOUR SKILLS. Commit to spending a certain number of hours per 
week reading or studying material to improve skills in your field. I 
have a set point of taking off one day per month from work to 
focus on studying and learning how to work better.
8. YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE. You might make fifteen minutes of 
meditation per day part of your spiritual practice, read several 
pages of spiritual literature each day, or pray or send your thoughts 
to someone dealing with a problem. My set point in this category is 
fifteen minutes minimum of daily meditation.
9. YOUR CAREER. Join a professional group and make sure you go to 
a certain number of meetings per year. Read one book per month 
on career issues. If you’re looking to change careers, commit to 
reading a certain number of articles online per week about this new 
field and how to break in.
10. YOUR CREATIVE LIFE. Choose and pursue a creative outlet, and set 
a reachable set point for making it part of your life. It could be 
spending twenty minutes journaling each day, joining a weekly 
improv class, or setting goals to move forward on a creative project 
that’s been stalled or you’ve been meaning to start. I have set points 
for the amount of writing I do every week.
11. YOUR FAMILY LIFE. Set a goal of spending a certain amount of time 
doing family-oriented activities per week, whether with your kids, 
the entire family, your parents, or other relatives. It could be calling 
your mom or dad every couple of days just to say hi, going out for 
Sunday breakfast as a family, having playtime with your children 
each evening.

12. YOUR COMMUNITY LIFE. Decide on an amount to donate annually 
to good causes, or identify a place where you’ll volunteer on a 
regular basis. I have an annual set point for money donated to 
charity. Each year I ensure I can give away a healthy sum to good 
causes I believe in.
Step 3: Test your set points and correct if you miss.
I test my fifty push-ups set point once a week. If I can’t do fifty—whether 
because I’ve been slacking off on exercise, my energy levels are low, or I’ve 
put on weight—I immediately initiate a set-point correction procedure.
My set-point correction procedure is a specific method to get me back 
on track. When it comes to fitness, it’s what I do when I need to get back 
into shape to do fifty. What works for me is to immediately go on a low-
carb diet for a week to get my weight back to normal and commit to work-
ing out at the gym three times a week. Typically in one week I’m back to 
fifty.
I turn forty the year this book is published. I intend to live to one hun -
dred. And even at that age I expect to be able to do fifty. I don’t believe in 
letting this slip.
The set-point correction procedure is a crucial part of this process. 
When you slip and can’t maintain a set point, you must be disciplined 
enough to correct it. This brings us to Step 4.
Step 4: Turn up the heat—in a good way.
When you slip off your set point, set a goal to get back to the set point plus 
a little bit more. Suppose fifty push-ups is your fitness set point. If you slip, 
aim to get back to fifty and a little more—say, to fifty-one. If you’ve stopped 
your weekly date nights with your partner, go back to the weekly date night 
but now add next-day mooky (my term for morning nooky). That’s turning 
up the heat—but so gradually that you don’t notice it. Once you reach that 
new level, make that your new set point.
Now you’ve not just prevented stagnation, you’re actually growing . 
Here’s what the set point system looks like when you map it out:
Most people slip with age. But when you apply non-negotiable set points,

you grow with age. I believe we all can be better than ever as we gain mile-
age in life—just make sure you make your set points non-negotiable. You 
can learn more about set points on www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
THE POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY OF SET POINTS
There’s a powerful reason why set points work. It’s a natural human ten -
dency to feel that we’ve failed when we slip from our goals. But with set 
points, a failure is turned into a challenge. If you can’t attain your fifty 
push-ups, you enact a new goal. Get to fifty-one. You replace the feeling of 
failure with the positive feeling of striving for a goal.
The key is to make the new goal easily achievable. Notice that my set-
point correction procedure for push-ups was to turn up the heat from fifty 
to fifty-one, not to fifty-five or sixty. Setting the bar too high is just punish-
ing; it’s unrealistic that you’ll make all of that progress in one giant leap. 
Turning up the heat just a little bit allows you to regain some momentum 
without setting yourself up to fail.
When you correct your set points by aiming slightly higher than before, 
you can put yourself on a path to constant improvement in every aspect of life.

This brings us to Law 5.
THE SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE
I’m going to ask you to do an exercise with me.
If you’re reading this book on a plane or subway or anywhere else with 
people around you, I want you to try to smell your neighbor. Go ahead. 
Lean just a little toward them and take a whiff.
If you’re reading this alone, try smelling yourself.
What do you smell? In most cases it’s going to be perfume, aftershave, a 
certain soap, or deodorant. Or not much of anything.
And that’s exactly the way it should be.
But if you were doing this exercise 150 years ago, everyone around you 
would have stunk. Back then, we didn’t have the practice of a daily shower. 
We weren’t trained to brush our teeth. Cologne and perfume were mostly 
used by the very wealthy. Deodorant didn’t exist. In the 1900s, humanity 
simply got used to its own stinking smell.
Today we do all kinds of things in the morning to clean and prepare our 
bodies for the day. We brush, shower, spray on cologne, and dress well, all 
to keep our physical bodies fresh and clean. Yet billions of us wake up each 
morning feeling worry, stress, anxiety, and fear and don’t do anything 
about it. We assume this is normal, but it’s not. Just as we can wash our 
bodies, so we can have systems to completely “wash” our minds of these 
debilitating feelings.
As the “smell your neighbor” exercise shows in a fun way, we pay far 
more attention to systems for taking care of our bodies than to systems that 
take care of our mind and spirit.
We’ve created a society where it’s considered normal to wake up with 
Law 5: Upgrade your systems for living.
Extraordinary minds consistently spend time discovering, upgrading, and 
measuring new systems for living applied to life, work, heart, and soul. They 
are in a perpetual state of growth and self-innovation.

feelings of stress, anxiety, fear, and worry. But it isn’t. These feelings 
aren’t meant to be constant states. They’re alarm systems, evolved to 
alert us to things we need to deal with, not just live with. You’re not 
supposed to hate your work or dread your day. “Happy hour” shouldn’t 
be the drinks you have on Friday to celebrate getting through another 
week.
Instead of taking pills or engaging in unhealthy habits to suppress our 
feelings, we can install systems to be free of them. What’s inspiring is how 
popular these new systems are proving to be—and how fast and powerful 
the transformations are. I call these systems transcendent practices. They 
include exercises on gratitude, meditation, compassion, bliss, and other 
practices that take you beyond or above the range of normal or merely 
physical human experiences.
Now that you understand how to discover, refresh, and create set points 
around your systems for living, we’re going to focus the rest of this book on 
systems for consciousness—in short transcendent practices. These systems 
can have an amazing payoff when applied to life and work, as you’ll see in 
the next chapter. But first I wanted to share some insights into how one of 
the world’s most powerful women is applying transcendent practices to run 
her business and life.
HOW ARIANNA HUFFINGTON  
RULES HER MIND
I got the beautiful opportunity to interview Arianna Huffington in 2014, 
just when her book Thrive was coming out. I adore Arianna; she radiates 
calmness and kindness while also running a massive media empire centered 
around the Huffington Post. Arianna shared with me some of the transfor-
mations that had been occurring in her life since she started adding 
transcendent practices to her busy day.
Arianna’s shift happened on April 6, 2007. She was two years into 
building the Huffington Post, having incredible success but working herself 
to the bone. And that’s when it hit her that money and power were not the 
only two metrics for success—there was a third that was not getting nearly 
enough airtime. She explained to me:

108 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
When building a start-up, it’s easy to buy into the delusion that 
we have to work around the clock trying to make everything happen. 
And then, of course, we have lives outside of work as well. As we 
were building the Huffington Post,  I was taking my older daughter 
around to check out colleges to see where she wanted to apply.
I came back from the college tour and collapsed from burnout, 
exhaustion, and sleep deprivation. I hit my head on my desk, broke 
my cheekbone, and needed four stitches on my right eye. As I was 
going from doctor to doctor to see if there was anything medically 
wrong with me, I was asking myself all of these questions that we 
often stop asking when we leave college: “What is a good life? 
What is success?” And I came to the conclusion that the way we 
define success, centered only on the two metrics of money and 
power, is just a very inadequate way to define life. It’s like trying to 
sit on a two-legged stool—sooner or later, we topple over. And 
that’s when I came up with this idea of the third metric of success, 
which consists of four pillars: well-being, wisdom, wonder, and 
giving.
Arianna went on to describe her daily systems for living. She spoke 
about meditation:
I don’t want just to be effective or productive. I want to be joyful. 
After eight hours of sleep, I also meditate every morning for at least 
twenty minutes. On the weekend, I try to do an hour or an hour-and-
a-half. I love it.
Then we discussed gratitude:
I used to wake up and the first thing I would do was check my 
smartphone. Now I don’t do that. And just taking this time—some -
times it can be literally a minute to just look ahead at my day and fill 
myself with gratitude for the blessings in my life, and set my inten -
tion for the day—it immediately takes away this false urgency that 
we bring into our lives that creates such unnecessary stress.

I love Arianna’s message. Her systems for living involve meditation, 
movement, gratitude, and setting an intention for the day. And that’s how 
one of the most powerful women in the world starts her day.
I once polled one of my audiences to learn their biggest challenges with 
meditation. Turns out one of the biggest challenges people have with med -
itation is that they simply can’t find the time. I call this the busyness par -
adox. It’s a paradox because meditation actually adds time to your day  
by optimizing your thinking and creative process to make you more 
functional.
Arianna is busy. She’s been named to Time magazine’s list of the world’s 
one hundred most influential people and the Forbes ranking of the one 
hundred most powerful women in the world.
Yet she told me:
It doesn’t take a lot of time. But then I can bring that quality into my 
day. Things happen in the course of my day, your day, I’m sure every-
body’s day that are challenging, that require us to deal with problems. 
So when that happens, as it inevitably does, I am in a place where I can 
address them without being overreactive, prioritizing what I need to 
handle right away, and without stressing about bad things happening.
She suggested that you can start with as little as five minutes a day:
Eventually you can build it up to twenty minutes, thirty minutes, 
or more. But even just a few minutes opens the door to creating a 
new habit and all the many proven benefits it brings, and I have 
fifty-five pages of scientific endnotes in the book about it.
I could probably have written an entire book from the wisdom I learned 
from Arianna. She is truly an amazing woman who shared many more of 
the systems she formed as daily habits that make her truly extraordinary.
You can watch a video of my full conversation with Arianna at   
www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary and learn about more systems that she 
uses in her daily life to set herself up for success and peaceful, happy living.

TRANSCENDENT PRACTICES  
AND WHERE WE’RE GOING NEXT
We can tie Arianna’s wisdom to philosopher Ken Wilber’s eloquent words 
in Chapter 3 about the need to apply transcendent practices to our models 
and systems in the modern world.
I believe we’re about to enter a new age of alignment between our phys-
ical bodies, our intellect, and our spirit. That is what we’re going to explore 
in the next part of this book as we go into your inner world.

YOURSELF
TRANSFORMING YOUR INNER WORLD
A
s you practice consciousness engineering, something beautiful 
starts to happen. As you gain a new sense of power and freedom 
from Brules that no longer hold you back, your growth starts to 
accelerate.
At this point a great yearning often starts building in you.
You want to do more, be more, contribute more.
This part of the book will give you the means to do so.
In previous chapters, you focused on the world around you and learned 
to shed models from the past. Now we’ll look at your present and your 
future, and we’ll focus on a new world—your inner world with all its con -
flicting habits, beliefs, emotions, desires, and ambitions. We’ll be bringing 
a beautiful order and balance to this world.
You’ll be asking yourself two questions:
 ■ What exactly is happiness, and how can I be happy in the present?
 ■ What are my goals and visions for the future?

You’ll learn new systems for living that allow you to dramatically raise 
your levels of happiness, including three powerful approaches that you can 
apply to be more blissful on a daily basis—I call it Blissipline: the discipline 
of daily bliss.
You’ll also discover how to create exciting goals for your future without 
succumbing to the Brules of the culturescape. You’ll learn the difference 
between end goals (a brilliant idea) and means goals (a bad idea). Best of 
all—you can do all of this by asking yourself three simple but profound 
questions.
When you’re happy in the present moment and pulled forward by a 
vision for the future, your inner and outer worlds mesh seamlessly. It almost 
feels as if luck is on your side, and the universe has your back. When you’re 
in this state, life seems to unfold for you in the best possible way—as if 
you’ve been blessed. I have a term for this. I call it bending reality.

LOVE AND ITS CAREER REPERCUSSIONS
I was hardly a poster boy for “Person Most Likely to Succeed” after college. 
My scorecard the first three years after graduation looked like this:
 ■ I tried and failed trying to launch two start-ups.
 ■ When I did try to get a decent job, I was fired. Twice.
Finally in 2002, after being a couch-crasher for a while, I got my dialing- 
for-dollars job selling legal software and got good enough at that (thanks 
to the practices I talked about in Chapter 3) to be promoted to director of 
sales and relocated to New York City to open the company’s East Coast 
office.
Then I hit another snag.
Love.
My girlfriend, Kristina, was amazing—the kind of woman who turned 
heads everywhere she went. But there was one big problem. She lived in 
Tallinn, Estonia, 4,167 miles away. Yes, I counted.
We tried to compensate by seeing each other every four months. We’d 
meet in Paris or Greece, and like star-crossed lovers on a budget, we’d have

the most romantic holidays we could in the cheap hotels that were all we 
could afford. It’s not every day that you meet a woman who’s so incredible 
you’ll tolerate a three-year long-distance relationship. So eventually I pro -
posed for two reasons: romantically—because we couldn’t wait to be living 
in the same city together and financially—because all those transatlantic 
flights and holidays were causing me to run out of cash.
So I asked my boss for four weeks off. The idea was to get married in 
Europe and then go on a honeymoon and spend some time visiting our 
folks. It all went well. But the day I arrived back in New York with Kris -
tina, I received a call from my boss. “You know I think you’re great, and I 
really like you,” he said, “But I couldn’t keep the position open. I had to 
replace you. Business is business.”
I was dumbstruck. I had no US green card and no way to find another 
job. Neither did Kristina. “Tell you what,” he said, “I can find another 
position for you. But it’ll be half your previous pay.” 
I remember standing there holding the phone, feeling as if my soul had 
collapsed onto the floor. Calmly, I replied, “Umm . . . okay. I’ll do it.”
Inside I wanted to scream expletives that would make a Marine blush.
Kristina, not having a green card, couldn’t work in the United States. 
Money was going to be tight, but we would not give up on our American 
dream.
Sometimes from the crappiest situations, opportunity arises. Since I had 
two mouths to feed and a salary that had been cut in half, I had to find 
other ways to make money. I’d read a couple of books about online market-
ing and figured that with my knowledge of coding and marketing, I could 
easily build a simple website to promote and sell a product I could buy 
wholesale. Since meditation was something I was interested in, I thought 
selling a meditation product would be a great way to start. I registered the 
first cheap domain I could find—mindvalley.com—and launched my little 
e-commerce store. I worked on it a few hours every evening after I got home 
from the office.
In my first month, I lost $800. In my second month, I lost $300. In my 
third month, I made a profit—a grand total of $4.50 for every day I worked. 
Still, it felt good. It bought breakfast at least. I loved my morning cup of 
Starbucks coffee. Now, I had a tiny website that earned me enough to buy 
a Starbucks coffee every single day. At first it was a Grande Café Mocha,

but the growth of my microbusiness did not stop. Soon I was making $5.50 
a day. I could upgrade to a Venti. That was a pretty exciting moment.
By month six, I was earning $6.50 every day—enough for a Venti with 
(drumroll please) hazelnut flavoring. A few months later, my little site was 
buying me my daily Starbucks and a Subway sandwich for lunch. Exciting 
times, indeed. I remember having beers with some friends at a bar, proudly 
telling them of my little side business that paid for breakfast and lunch each 
day—and how in a few months, it would pay for dinner, too.
That was basically how Mindvalley started. It wasn’t about building a 
business. No big goals. No deadlines. Just this little game to see how much 
food I could get with my profits. Without realizing it, I’d stumbled upon a 
secret that video-game designers and psychologists had long been aware of. 
I was “gamifying” my life.
The money continued to grow. I soon had a new goal. I knew my mini -
mum livable income was $4,000. That was what Kristina and I needed to 
eat, pay rent, live in Manhattan on a modest budget, and reinvest in the 
business. I was earning $7,500 from my job, but I really needed just $4,000 
to survive in New York with Kristina at that time. Right before Thanksgiv-
ing 2003, I hit that number for Mindvalley’s monthly earnings. I called my 
boss and resigned.
FROM GAME TO GRIND
Quitting my job as a law firm software salesman meant that I no longer 
had a US visa. Kristina and I faced a choice. We could return to Estonia, 
her home, or to Malaysia, where I was born. Estonia is a beautiful nation, 
but its winters are dreadful, so we settled on Malaysia for its warmer 
weather.
I’d like to be able to say that this is the whole story for why we left. But 
there’s more. In the years following September 11, the United States was on 
high alert. For some reason, I was put on a watch list called Special Regis -
tration, which was designed to monitor foreign visitors from specific coun-
tries. Malaysia unfortunately made the list, and someone in the State 
Department decided that I was “suspicious” enough that I should be 
monitored.
I could travel only via certain airports, and it included an exhaustive

two- to three-hour extra wait at immigration for special screening. But 
worst of all, every thirty days while in the United States, I had to register 
myself at the local immigration office. I would be required to wait in a 
line—sometimes standing outside in the cold for four hours in a line that 
stretched more than a block long, until an officer could see me, fingerprint 
me, take a photograph, and check my credit card purchases to see if I had 
made any dangerous purchases. It was horrible and demeaning.
After tolerating this for four months, Kristina and I decided we had to 
give up our American dream and move to a new country. I never stopped 
being in love with the United States. Although I grew up in Malaysia, I still 
feel more American than anything else, but I couldn’t stay in the country I 
loved while being forced to live according to parolelike rules.
So I ended up home in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I was precisely halfway 
across the world from my close friends in New York, my favorite city in the 
world, and my customers and business vendors.
At first the Malaysia office of Mindvalley included just me and my faithful 
Labradoodle, Ozzy (whom I listed as my PR manager: “the first dog in the 
country to hold a paid position in e-commerce”). Soon, though, we started 
growing. I hired my first employees and expanded into a small office space at 
the back of a warehouse in a run-down part of the city. We then started ramp-
ing up with more staff and projects. Suddenly, I had to run a “real” business. 
Rent. Hiring. Payroll. Filing taxes. Dealing with banks. I loved the work itself 
but was dragged down by all the worries of running the day-to-day. Being so 
far removed from the United States posed its challenges.
I struggled, working crazy-long hours. And to make matters worse, I was 
hitting a glass ceiling. The next four years would be relatively unremarkable. 
There were ups and downs, and we grew to eighteen people, but our business 
was still finding its way. At least it paid the bills. By May 2008, I found myself 
in a dilemma. The company was making a quarter-million dollars of revenue 
per month, but losing $15,000 per month. If the bleeding didn’t stop, I’d have 
to start laying off some of our eighteen employees.
The game had become a grind. It was definitely one of those dips we 
talked about in Chapter 1. But something really beautiful was about to hap-
pen. I just didn’t know it yet. It would cause a major shift in my models of 
reality. It would spark me to adopt new systems of living for my life and work. 
And the result would be so powerful that in just eight months, I would grow 
the company beyond my wildest imaginings and forever change my own life.

What Happened Next
What exactly shifted in me? I’ll get to that in a minute. First, here’s what 
happened in just eight months after the shift.
 ■ THE BUSINESS EXPLODED. From being on the verge of laying people 
off, we grew 400 percent in revenue in just eight months. We’d never 
experienced growth like this. In May 2008, we did $250,000 in sales. 
Eight months later, by December of the same year. we’d had our first 
million-dollar month.
 ■ WORK BECAME FUN.  I no longer felt suffocated by the pressure or 
the grind.
 ■ WE STARTED GETT ING DR EAM CL IENTS. No m ore working the 
phones and haggling. Often clients came to us. Part of my role became 
learning to say no.
 ■ WE GOT AN AMAZ ING T EAM.  In a year, we grew from eighteen 
employees to fifty.
But the best was yet to come. By May 2009, just one year after almost 
going bust, my life had completely transformed. That was a month I’ll never 
forget. I spent just six days in the office and twenty-one days on beaches 
around the world. I attended a friend’s wedding in Cabo, Mexico. I spent 
nine days with Tony Robbins in his resort in Fiji. I got to spend several days 
with Richard Branson and others on his private island, Necker—a dream 
come true for me. While all of this was happening, our company had its 
best-ever month—a new single-day sales record. I was at Tony Robbins’s 
private villa in Fiji with Tony and his wife when I got the news on my 
phone. I had an incredible business. A wife and a family. An amazing life. 
And for the first time, I loved it all.
Magic seemed to be happening all around. My wildest dreams were 
coming true. It was as if I had been blessed with sudden luck. So, what was 
the insight that caused my life to shift so rapidly in such a short time?
BENDING REALITY FOR FUN AND PROFIT

heads according to “truths” that we absorbed from the culturescape. You’ve 
identified important Brules that have been limiting your life, and you’ve 
started applying the principles of consciousness engineering to detect the 
models of belief and systems for living that may be holding you back. Thus, 
you’ve adopted a new and robust framework for personal growth.
But there’s more to come. As you start playing with consciousness engi-
neering and experimenting with new ways of thinking and living, life starts 
to feel more spacious and exciting. You become ready to do more, be more, 
and really thrive as a human being. Having mastered the art of liberating 
yourself from the culturescape, you’re ready for a new level of mastery: 
mastery of your own inner self. You’re now ready to recode yourself into a 
new type of human being and to make your own dent in the universe.
But you’re not going to do it in any conventional way (culture hackers 
just don’t work like that). Instead, you’re going to question and redefine 
two of the biggest pillars of how we define success—namely, happiness and 
the attainment of goals.
You’re going to get both in massive quantities, but not through struggle 
and striving. Rather, they’ll come through attaining a balance—a delicate 
balance in your state of being between your levels of happiness and your vision 
for your future. I call living in this state “bending reality” for a reason—I’ve 
found that when I put myself in this state, it almost seems as if the universe 
has my back and luck seems to be on my side. It’s as if I can bend reality to 
make my days perfect and my visions unfold at spectacular speed. This was 
the state I entered in the summer of 2008 when my life and business started 
expanding at a massive rate. Like a good engineer, I decided to try to decode 
this state so I could replicate it in myself and others.
IT’S ALL HAPPENING IN YOUR MIND
In the spring of 2008, as my business was struggling, I decided to stop what 
I was doing and take a break from the countless start-up and marketing 
strategies I was studying about and working long hours to implement. 
Instead, I decided to pour myself into personal growth.
I knew something was off. I just did not know what. But I knew it 
was something internal. I studied countless books and attended a num -
ber of seminars. Books by Bob Proctor and Neale Donald Walsch and 
seminars by T. Harv Eker and Esther Hicks gave me deep insights—the

biggest of which was the idea that our beliefs shape our world.
I knew this intellectually, but I could not seem to make it work in a 
powerful way. And so I kept beating my head against a wall trying to make 
my business survive and thrive. I watched as our bank savings dwindled, 
and the threat of layoffs loomed ever larger. I came to work trying to act 
confident in front of my staff, but deep inside I felt like a failure.
I can’t remember when the key insight came to me, but when it did, it 
was profound. And it went like this: Stop postponing your happiness. Be 
happy now. Your thoughts and beliefs do create your reality, but only 
when your present state is joyful. I realized I was running on empty and the 
fuel I desperately needed was happiness. I did have much to be happy about, 
but I was so obsessed and stressed out about meeting our revenue goals that 
my dominant thoughts were fear and anxiety.
I thought back to the early years when I would celebrate making $4.50 
a day by buying myself a Starbucks coffee. It seemed so simple back then—I 
was grateful for every small win—and I realized there was no reason I 
couldn’t adopt that same model of reality now. Keep the big goals—just 
don’t tie your happiness to your goals. Be happy now.
I decided to change my game and my mind-set. I set new goals to get us 
out of the revenue slump, but I also decided to make fun and happiness a 
key part of my day. I was not going to postpone my happiness until I 
attained some future goal.
As I started hacking my life and work in this way, the needle started to 
move. I wrote down my target for June: to hit $300K in revenue. We hit it. 
I took my entire team to a beach holiday to celebrate and have fun. There 
we set a new target: $500K for the month. I still have on my wall today a 
picture of my team from 2008 holding up a sign on the beach with that goal 
on it. We pushed hard—but we did it while having a blast. We hit $500K 
by October. Then we set a new goal: $1 million.
I don’t know how it happened. But we crossed the million-dollar mark 
that December. From May 2008 to December 2008 we had grown our 
monthly revenue from $250K to $1 million in a mere eight months. And I 
was having fun and the ride of my life all along.
It all started with that shift in my mental model:
Have big goals—but don’t tie your happiness to your goals. 
You must be happy before you attain them.

120 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
I’ve since formulated this model into the philosophy I call bending real-
ity. Bending reality is so named because when you’re operating in this state, 
you tend to have a feeling that everything in life is bending in your direc -
tion, that you are effortlessly making things happen—and that anything is 
possible.
And so it’s a subtle balance:
1. You have a bold vision for the future pulling you forward.
2. Yet . . . you’re happy in the NOW.
But here’s the key: BOTH of these stem from the present. As Paulo 
Coelho said in The Alchemist:
Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested 
only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, 
you’ll be a happy man.
There’s no point dwelling in the past and letting it define you, nor in 
getting lost in anxiety about the future. In the present moment, you’re in 
the field of possibility. How you engage with the present moment will direct 
your life.
When you’re bending reality, your vision is continuously pulling you 
forward—but it doesn’t feel like work. It feels like a game, a game you love 
to play. But at the same time, your happiness does not seem to be tied to 
that future vision. You’re feeling elated and happy right now, in this 
moment. You’re happy as you pursue your vision, not only when you attain 
it. You’re thus grounded in the present.
Are you ready to try out this new model? Here’s what I now understand 
about how it works.
THE FOUR STATES OF HUMAN LIVING
Think of happiness in the now and vision for the future as two ingredients 
that can be combined, but that have to be in balance. Too much of one or 
the other creates imbalance and limitation. Depending on how they’re com-
bined, at any moment in life, we can be in one of four different states of 
mind. This napkin drawing will help you see it.

1. T HE NEGATIVE SPIRAL. In this state, you’re not happy in the now, 
nor do you have a vision of your future. With little to enjoy or look 
forward to, this is a painful place to be, and certainly not one 
where you want to spend any significant amount of time. Often 
when in this state you’re feeling depressed.
2. T HE CURRENT REALITY TRAP. This state feels great because you’re 
happy in the now. There’s nothing wrong with being in this state 
now and then—for example, when you’re having an amazing 
experience or are on vacation. But remember, happiness alone can 
be fleeting. You can get happy from smoking a joint. But long-term 
happiness and fulfillment come from something more—the need to 
contribute, grow, and do meaningful things. While this state may 
bring you temporary happiness, it won’t bring you long-term 
fulfillment.
3. STRESS AND ANXIETY. This is the state I was in during the years I 
struggled to build my business. A lot of entrepreneurs are in this 
state, as are a lot of career-driven people. In this state, you may 
have big goals, but you’ve tied your happiness to those goals. You’re 
waiting to sign the next big deal, move into that new office, hit that 
next revenue milestone—before you celebrate. It’s great to think big

and to want to accomplish amazing things, but it’s not an optimal 
state if you’re postponing your happiness along the way. If you’re 
working hard but aren’t making progress or if you feel you have a 
lot to offer but aren’t getting where you want to go, you may be 
stuck in this state.
4. BENDING REALITY. This is the ideal state where you’re happy in 
the now, and you have a vision for the future that drives you. Your 
vision pulls you forward, but you’re happy now—despite not having 
yet attained that vision. When you’re in this state, there’s a feeling 
of growth and enjoyment. It’s about the journey as well as the 
destination. An interesting observation about this state is that it 
often seems as if the universe “has your back.” Call it what you 
want—but it starts to feel as if you’re lucky. The right 
opportunities, ideas, and people seem to gravitate to you. It’s as if 
your happiness is rocket fuel moving you toward your vision.
THE TWO ELEMENTS OF BENDING REALITY
Now that you have a sense of where bending reality falls on the spectrum 
of life, let’s take a closer look at the two key elements that must be in play 
in order to get there.
1. Be happy in the now.
A key ingredient of this state is that your happiness is not tied to attaining 
your vision. It comes from the pursuit of your vision, combined with a sense 
of gratitude for what you already have.
That way, you don’t have to wait for happiness. It’s just the natural 
by-product of pursuing your vision. You feel a deep sense of fulfillment. 
And you feel insanely motivated to keep moving forward. Your work 
becomes like a craving. You can work twelve hours straight, and you 
might feel tired, but you won’t burn out. All the truly great people I 
know have this beautiful happiness associated with pursuing their goals. 
Indeed, I think it’s the only way to truly attain your goals—to be happy

as you make the long, sometimes difficult climb toward great visions.
On Necker Island, as we were masterminding with Branson and getting 
life lessons from him, someone from my group asked him, “You’re always 
happy. What do you do when you’re sad?”
Branson replied, “I can’t remember the bad times. I only remember the 
good things that happened in my life.”
That was certainly one thing I noticed about hanging out with him: He’s 
always about having fun. He has huge goals. He’s one of the biggest think-
ers I’ve ever met, yet he’s perpetually in play.
And it’s not just Branson. Go back a hundred years and there’s another 
influential titan of his time who penned this little poem:
I was early taught to work as well as play,
My life has been one long, happy holiday;
Full of work and full of play—
I dropped the worry on the way—
And God was good to me every day.
That titan was John D. Rockefeller, who wrote the poem at age eighty-
six. During his time he was one of the richest men in the world. Rockefeller 
speaks so simply and clearly here about dropping worry and about merging 
work and play into a life that is “one long, happy holiday.” And where he 
says God was good to him, others might replace that with “luck” or “for -
tune” or “the universe.”
So, no matter where you are in your life today, you must remember this 
lesson: Your happiness cannot be tied to your goals. You must be happy 
even before you attain them. Doing so will make life joyous and full of play 
and bring your goals to you faster than ever.
Getting There: Insights for Hacking Happiness
We make it hard for ourselves to achieve happiness because we’ve been 
trained to think about it in the wrong way. Many of us have fallen into the 
trap of the “if/then” model of happiness: If X happens (if I get the right job, 
find the perfect mate, buy that dream house, have a baby, write a bestsell -
ing book, etc., then I’ll be happy.

124 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
To me, that’s a flawed model in two ways:
1. IT PUTS HAPPINESS OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN POWER. It gives it 
to a job, another person, a house, a baby, or a book, among other 
things—and how crazy is that?
2. WHEN WE’RE HAPPY, WE PERFORM BETTER, ATTRACT OTHERS, 
AND IN GENERAL KICK ASS IN LIFE. I got stuck in stress and 
anxiety because I had hitched my happiness bandwagon to the 
future success of my business. So when the business went into 
crisis, I went into crisis, which put me in the totally wrong mind-set 
to get the business out of crisis, which threw me into a deeper crisis, 
which became a swirling spiral of unhappy crises. I have seen this 
happen to many successful people.
We shouldn’t do things so we can be happy. We should be 
happy so we can do things.
Your happiness will accelerate your movement toward your goals, but it 
should not be tied to them. The best thing you can do to meet your goals is 
to find a life balance that allows you to be happy now. Integrate practices 
into your daily routines that allow you to feel content and focus on the 
journey, not the destination. That’s how you’ll break free of stress and anx-
iety and be in the best position to fulfill your vision. We’ll explore such 
practices in the next chapter.
2. Develop an exciting vision for your future.
I’ve observed that almost all of the extraordinary people I’ve met or read 
about have one thing in common: They have a vision for their future. It may 
be a new piece of art to create, a service or product to bring to the world, a 
mountain to climb, or a family to raise.
These people live in the future in some way. Conventional spiritual 
growth advocates talk about the need to be “present.” I believe that being 
present is only part of the story. Happiness in the now grounds you in the 
present. But you need bold dreams pulling you forward, too. Extraordinary 
people intend to leave a mark on the world.

Now, a word of warning. You need to make sure that your goals aren’t 
Brule-based, or you might end up chasing something that feels meaningless 
once you acquire it—as happened to me when I got my first big gig at 
Microsoft—or as happens to countless entrepreneurs when they build a 
business with the goal of earning a living, only to feel trapped in the usual 
nine-to-five when they achieve their goal.
Instead, you want a vision for the future that speaks to your soul. This 
vision is typically what we call an end goal—which you’ll learn how to set 
for yourself in Chapter 8 using a process called the Three Most Important 
Questions.
Getting There: Insights for Hacking Vision
I’ve lost count of the number of books I’ve read that give instructions on 
goal setting, from growing a business to simply getting organized. But just 
as we’ve been trained to think about happiness in a limiting way, so modern 
goal setting leads us astray. It happens in three ways:
1. WE CONFUSE BRULES WITH GOALS. When we set a goal that  
we must have a certain kind of job, a certain kind of lifestyle,  
or a certain kind of appearance, often these are Brules installed 
by society. Extraordinary minds pay little attention to the 
infectious “wants” of the culturescape. Instead, they create  
their own goals.
2. WE CAN ONLY VISUALIZE WHAT WE KNOW. While there’s 
nothing wrong with visualizing and pursuing what we think will 
make us happy, we can really only visualize what we already know. 
What if there are even more wonderful visions and goals you could 
attain—gifts that only you can give the world—if only those 
unseen, unknown visions could be brought to the surface? We’ll 
explore this in Part IV of the book.
3. WE’RE NOTORIOUSLY BAD AT PREDICTING JUST WHAT WE 
CAN DO IN A GIVEN TIME FRAME. We tend to a) bite off way 
more than we can chew in the short term, and b) not expect nearly 
enough of ourselves in the long term. Both tendencies work against 
successful visioneering. We tend to overestimate what we can do in 
one year and underestimate what we can do in three years.

In the next two chapters, we’ll dive deeper into the practice of creating 
happiness in the now and the art of establishing beautiful visions for your 
future. But for now, this brings us to Law 6.
Exercise: The Eight Statements
The simple set of eight statements below will help you gauge where you are 
on the path to bending reality. Indicate how true each statement is for you 
by selecting one of the choices offered. There are no right or wrong answers. 
If you’re still in the starting gate, no worries. We’ll be talking more about 
how to get there.
1. I love my current job to the point where it does not feel like work.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
2. My work is meaningful to me.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
3. There are often moments at work that make me so happy the time just 
flies by.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
4. When things go wrong, I don’t worry at all. I just know something 
good is on the horizon.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
5. I feel excited about my future, knowing even better things are always 
on their way.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
Law 6: Bend reality.
Extraordinary minds are able to bend reality. They have bold and exciting 
visions for the future, yet their happiness is not tied to these visions. They 
are happy in the now. This balance allows them to move toward their visions 
at a much faster rate while having a ton of fun along the way. To outsiders, 
they seem “lucky.”

6. Stress and anxiety don’t seem to faze me much. I trust in my ability to 
attain my goals.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
7. I look forward to the future because I have unique and bold goals on 
the horizon.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
8. I spend a good amount of time thinking excitedly about my visions for 
the future.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE SOMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
If you answered “Very true” to statements 1 through 4, you are likely happy in the now.
If you answered “Very true” to statements 5 through 8, you likely have a good vision for 
your future.
If you can answer “Very true” for all eight statements, you’re likely in the state of bend -
ing reality. 
Most people, however, find that they tend to be able to answer “Very true” to either 
the happiness-related statements or to the vision-related questions, but not to 
both.
HOW BENDING REALITY FEELS
Bending reality feels almost magical. Everything seems to “click.” You’re 
working, but it doesn’t feel like work because you love what you’re doing. 
When I’m in this state, I almost feel as if work doesn’t exist. Plus, intuition 
and insights seem to come easily, out of the blue. Maybe this is because 
your mind is focused so intensely on your vision that you’re alert to 
everything that will help achieve it and you’re in a happy, joyous state that 
opens you up to creativity. Sometimes it seems as if the right people, coin -
cidences, and opportunities come to you, nudging and pushing you toward 
your goals. Is this the mystical law of attraction? Or is it what’s known as 
the brain’s reticular activating system? To me it doesn’t matter. It’s a model 
of reality that serves me well.
If you can choose any model of reality you want and accept it 
as true—why not choose a model that suggests that you can 
literally bend reality to your wishes?

128 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
For all of these reasons, I call this the ultimate state of human existence. 
From a purely practical standpoint, I also believe it’s the ultimate produc -
tivity hack. When you’re in this state, it feels as if you’re bending reality to 
accelerate yourself toward the visions you have in your mind, visions that 
come to you easily and without anxiety.
Almost everyone has experienced this sensation at one time or another, 
but the trick is staying in this ultimate state for longer and longer periods. 
The most extraordinary people know how to do this.
It’s actually a discipline you can learn and practice. I call it Blissipline. 
And it’s coming up next.
I first presented these ideas on bending reality at a speech in Calgary, 
Alberta, in 2009, when I shared the stage with His Holiness the Dalai 
Lama. My speech included the story in this chapter and expanded it to 
applications within businesses and teams. Back then, I described it as 
“being in flow.” I have since changed the terminology as I have become 
better at the practice through the years. As you yourself master it, you will 
begin to see that it is not only your own “flow” you can mold but rather the 
full spectrum of the world around you. You can watch that full speech on

Where We Learn about the Important Discipline 
of Maintaining Daily Bliss
It turns out that our brains are literally hardwired to perform 
at their best not when they are negative or even neutral, but 
when they are positive. Yet in today’s world, we ironically 
sacrifice happiness for success only to lower our brain’s suc-
cess rates.

THE BILLIONAIRE WHO DANCES ON TABLES
It was another beautiful night on Necker Island, Richard Branson’s gor -
geous getaway in the British Virgin Islands. Kristina and I were sitting at a 
huge long wooden table with Richard and his other guests, dining on delec-
table food and free-flowing drinks. We’d just returned from the beach, and 
everyone was in a playful mood—perhaps because our host, Branson, radi -
ated that vibe.
But as the meal went on, I noticed that several entrepreneurs there 
seemed to try to steer the conversation toward more serious matters. They 
started hitting Richard with business questions. Someone asked about an 
investment opportunity. Another asked for advice about running a large 
company. I can’t blame them. When you’re in the presence of such a legend-
ary entrepreneur, you can’t help but want to glean a few nuggets of his 
wisdom. Still, I felt that their timing was off. This was meant to be a fun, 
casual dinner.

Then Richard did something surprising. He politely halted the conver -
sation. In his flip-flops, he climbed onto the table amid our plates and 
glasses. He then extended his hand to Kristina, who was sitting next to me, 
and helped her up onto the table.
“Let’s dance,” he said.
And they did. A beautiful slow dance right there in the middle of the 
feast while everyone else watched—surprised and amused—cutlery and 
wine glasses be damned.
It was the perfect reminder that life is not all business. We’re here in this 
brief span of time to be happy together. And it was so perfectly Richard 
Branson, who is an inspiration to me as an extraordinary person who’s 
mastered the art of working toward big visions while being persistently 
happy in the present.
INTRODUCING BLISSIPLINE:  
THE DISCIPLINE OF DAILY BLISS
When Richard Branson restored fun to a special dinner, he was demon -
strating that happiness is under our control. When things get out of bal -
ance, you can bring yourself back to bliss.
Science is showing us that one of the key things that lets us function 
optimally in the world is our ability to control our happiness level. It’s a 
requirement for learning to bend reality. While it’s a trainable skill, many 
of us still find it elusive.
In this chapter, I’ll introduce a simple system for mastering happiness in 
the now. It goes beyond feeling peaceful to feeling truly joyous. It combines 
spiritual mastery with the real-world desire to meet your goals and make 
your intentions come true. I call it Blissipline: the discipline of daily bliss.
Why Happiness Matters
Studies abound on the link between happiness and effectiveness. Here are 
just a few of the compelling findings.
HAPPINESS CAN IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AT YOUR JOB. In the bril-
liant book The Happiness Advantage , Shawn Achor describes a common 
med school exercise in which doctors in training make a diagnosis based 
111-168_152510_CEM_P3.indd   130 3/4/16   1:19 PM

 LIV E IN BLISSIPLINE  131
on a rundown of a patient’s symptoms and history. It’s a test of the doc’s 
knowledge and ability to think outside the box, not getting wedded to 
one diagnosis (known as anchoring). In one study three groups of doctors 
were asked to do this kind of analysis. One group was “primed to feel 
happy” before the exercise, another group was asked to read “neutral” 
medical material beforehand, and the “control” group wasn’t given any -
thing prior to the exercise. The happiness-primed docs were almost twice 
as speedy at making the right diagnosis compared to those in the control 
group—and beat them soundly at avoiding anchoring, too. What was this 
mysterious priming? The doctors in the happiness group were given a 
little candy. And they weren’t even allowed to eat it to avoid possibly 
skewing the study results by performing with elevated blood sugar! 
Which leads to the amusing question that Achor asks in his book: “Per -
haps patients should start offering their doctors lollipops, instead of the 
other way around.”
GOOD ATTITUDES YIELD BETTER RESULTS. Martin Seligman, PhD, a 
pioneer in the field of positive psychology and author of Learned Opti -
mism, screened 15,000 newly hired salespeople at MetLife using a test he 
developed to measure optimism levels, and then followed their performance 
for three years. The salespeople who scored in the top 10 percent for opti -
mism performed a whopping 88 percent better in sales than the reps in the 
top 10 percent for pessimism. Dr. Seligman found that the power of opti -
mism held in other professions, too. He concluded that in general, optimis-
tic salespeople performed an impressive 20 to 40 percent better than 
pessimistic salespeople.
HAPPINESS MAY HELP KIDS LEARN. In his book The Happiness Advan-
tage, Shawn Achor describes a study with four-year-olds who were given 
some “learning tasks” to do. One group was asked to think of something 
that made them happy; the other wasn’t. The happy-thought group did a 
speedier job on the task and didn’t make as many mistakes—which makes 
you wonder what might happen if we designed schools to take into account 
a student’s happiness.
With so much evidence on how happiness boosts performance, it seems 
evident that learning to control and maintain our happiness is an important 
part of extraordinary living. But first we have to answer the question—
what exactly is happiness?

132 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
How Happiness Happens
Before we dive into the practice of Blissipline, it’s important to first define 
the idea of happiness. I believe that there are three distinct types of 
happiness.
1. Happiness from Special and Unique Experiences
This is the happiness that comes from unique human experiences. There’s 
the heart-pounding bliss of incredible sex. The fist-pumping elation of win-
ning a sports game. The chest-thumping excitement of closing a major deal. 
The mind-bending bliss of ecstatic experiences, chemically induced or oth -
erwise. This bliss is powerful—present moment and short-lived. Sometimes 
there’s a crash or letdown afterward as your brain chemistry descends from 
this high. In small doses, it’s fantastic, but it can be distracting, addictive, 
and potentially destructive. If we were hooked up to instant bliss machines 
that pumped this chemistry through us 24/7, civilization would cease to 
progress (and we’d be too blissed-out to care). Happiness from unique expe-
riences is a kind of short-term happiness—but it can’t be the only kind.
2. Happiness from Growth and Awakening
While bliss from experiences is wonderful, there’s a second type of happi -
ness. It’s more rare but seems to be more enduring. It’s the happiness advo-
cated by spiritual practitioners and transcendent practices. I call it happiness 
from growth and awakening. This type of happiness comes from reaching 
higher states of consciousness. People seek awakening in many different 
ways—from mindfulness practices to spiritual paths and practices of all 
kinds. The millions who pursue some type of spiritual path show how 
important this level of happiness is to human beings.
3. Happiness from Meaning
I adore my kids, but let’s be honest: There are times when parenting is no 
fun. I’ve had nights of no sleep, dealt with icky diapers, and walked the 
floor for hours at a time with a wailing baby. So, I wouldn’t say I’m always 
happy as a parent. And studies bear this out: Having kids tends to lessen 
happiness. But even on the difficult days, I wouldn’t trade it for anything. 
The overwhelming majority of parents say the same thing.

 LIV E IN BLISSIPLINE  133
Social psychologist Roy Baumeister, PhD, has found that this “parent -
hood paradox” is explained when the search for meaning is added into the 
equation. Parenting is highly meaningful, even though it’s also highly 
demanding and requires personal sacrifices that go against short-term hap -
piness. What’s interesting about the parenthood paradox is that it seems to 
indicate that we humans find meaning so important that we’ll sacrifice a 
certain amount of happiness for it.
Meaning is what we get from having a healthy vision for the future, as 
we discussed in Chapter 6. It’s a critical component of happiness. In the 
chapters that follow, we’ll take a deeper dive into how to find the meaning 
and mission that will put you on your personal path to extraordinary 
living.
These three types of happiness tiptoe with us through life. Opportuni -
ties to find unique experiences, growth and awakening, and meaning are 
always around us. Most of us just don’t look as hard as we could. And the 
reason for this is that we get tuned to function at a particular preset happi-
ness level.
Your Happiness Gauge
Think back to a time of supreme happiness in your life. Maybe it was the 
day you fell in love, got married, had a baby, achieved a dream goal, had a 
spiritual epiphany, or just felt glad to be alive. Spend a few moments feeling 
those feelings. Incredible, right?
Now, sense how you’re feeling right now.
Chances are, you’re neither at your highest high nor your lowest low 
right now. You’re likely somewhere in between. We don’t generally spend 
too long at the very top or the very bottom of our emotional spectrum.
Studies show that each of us has a particular level of happiness that we 
tend to return to after things happen, good or bad. Researchers call this 
phenomenon hedonic adaptation. While hedonic adaptation can help insu -
late us from being forever flattened by tragedy, it can mean that even the joy 
of hugely positive events doesn’t stick with us for long. We humans are so 
good at adapting that we adapt to whatever has happened and then con -
tinue along in life.
But research has found that our happiness is hackable. You’ve already

learned how to raise your set points for the Twelve Areas of Balance in 
your life. Happiness is no different. It’s all part of optimizing your systems 
for living. It turns out that you can actually raise your happiness level to 
experience higher levels of happiness every day of your life, too, no matter 
what is going on around you. There are three specific systems for living that 
can be especially helpful for this.
THE PATH TO BLISSIPLINE: THREE SYSTEMS 
FOR ADVANCING YOUR HAPPINESS LEVELS
The three Blissipline systems below will help you upgrade your quality of 
life every day. They’re called transcendent practices: conscious practices 
that you internalize or embody. You’ll know if they’re working because 
you’ll experience higher levels of satisfaction in daily life—and the boost in 
happiness usually comes instantly.
Does this mean that bad things won’t happen or that you’ll never be 
unhappy? Of course not. But it does mean that you’ll have the Blissipline to 
deal with adversity from a positive place and the capacity to recover to a 
higher happiness set point than before.
The three systems below are all scientifically proven to create a boost in 
happiness; in some cases, a long-lasting boost that can span months. These 
are the three systems I used to pull myself out of stress and anxiety in 2008 
and revive my career and business. These systems will also help you weather 
the inevitable dips you might face as you pursue a thrilling, “unsafe” life 
outside the Brules.
Blissipline System 1: The Power of Gratitude
Perhaps no single exercise leads to as big a happiness boost as the practice 
of gratitude—so much so that gratitude is getting significant notice in 
research and scientific circles. The list of scientifically proven benefits for 
the practice of gratitude now includes:
 ■ More energy
 ■ More forgiving attitudes
 ■ Less depression

 ■ Less anxiousness
 ■ More feelings of being socially connected
 ■ Better sleep
 ■ Fewer headaches
A study by Robert A. Emmons, PhD, and Michael McCullough, PhD, 
showed that people who simply wrote down five things they were thankful 
for from the previous week showed a 25 percent difference in happiness 
levels compared to people who wrote down five negative things from the 
week. They also exercised more and said they felt healthier.
Dr. Emmons did another study in which people wrote down positive 
things each day. Not only did they report an even greater gratitude boost, 
but they also said they helped other people more. Apparently gratitude 
leads to giving, which in turn boosts the happiness and gratitude of others. 
That’s the kind of social contagion I can get behind.
Appreciating the Reverse Gap
So, how can you make the experience of gratitude a daily occurrence in 
your life? Switch your “gap.” This idea comes from entrepreneurial coach 
Dan Sullivan. As shown in the diagram below, most of us are trained to 
watch the forward gap—the gap between where you are now and where 
you want to be. The problem is that we tell ourselves we’ll be happy when 
we reach that new revenue target at work . . . finally get married . . . have a 
baby . . . have X amount of money in the bank, and so on:

136 THE CODE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MIND
But there’s a problem here. If you’re chasing the forward gap, the chase 
will never end. No matter how good life gets, you’ll always be chasing the 
next idea on the horizon. And just like the actual horizon, you can’t catch 
it. It will always remain ahead of you. Tying happiness to the attainment of 
some future goal is like trying to catch up to the horizon. It’s always going 
to be one step beyond your reach.
Instead, Dan suggests we look backward—to the past—and appreciate 
how far we’ve come. Dan calls this the reverse gap:
Dan explains it this way:
The moment I start feeling disappointed or discouraged or I start 
feeling really tense, I immediately say, “Okay, what are you measur -
ing against?” and sure enough, I’m measuring against the ideal. And 
the moment I say, “Okay, turn around, where did you come from?” 
And the moment I turn around and I measure backwards [from] my 
starting point for this particular activity—bang, I feel great.  . . .  I’ve 
learned a lot. We’ve made tremendous progress. . . .  In a matter of a 
few seconds, I go from the negative zone of being in the gap to the 
positive zone of measuring my actual progress.
Even in tough times, you can look back and see how far you’ve come, how 
much you’ve learned, and the support you’ve received along the way. Paying 
attention to the “reverse gap” is a perfect exercise in gratitude and is far more

likely to give you a boost of happiness than striving for happiness in the 
future. That’s why gratitude is such a powerful system for Blissipline.
I believe every day should begin and end with gratitude. I practice it 
every day in my morning meditation. Each morning, focusing on the reverse 
gap, I think of five things I’m grateful for in my personal life. Then I think 
of five things I’m grateful for in my work and career. A typical list might 
look like this:
PERSONAL LIFE
1. My daughter, Eve, and her beautiful smiles
2. The happiness I felt last night relaxing with a glass of red wine and 
watching Sherlock on BBC
3. My wife and life partner
4. The time I spent with my son building his newest Lego Star Wars 
creation
5. The wonderful cup of gourmet coffee my publicist, Tania, left on 
my desk
WORK LIFE
1. My leadership team and the amazing talent they bring to our 
company
2. A particularly great letter we received for my online course 
Consciousness Engineering
3. The incredibly fun Culture Day we had in the office yesterday
4. The fact that plans are coming together to hold our upcoming 
A-Fest at another amazing location
5. Having coworkers who are friends and who greet me with hugs 
when I come to the office
This entire practice takes me no more than ninety seconds. But it’s per-
haps one of the most important and powerful ninety seconds I can spend 
each day.

Exercise: Daily Gratitude
In Chapter 4, you learned two gratitude exercises that take just a minute or 
two each and help prevent negative models of reality from taking root. 
Here, we’ll take the process a little deeper. Each day, take a few minutes to 
focus on the reverse gap—what has happened in your life that you’re grate -
ful for? Think about:
Three to five things you’re grateful for in your personal life
Three to five things you’re grateful for in your work life
For some people, expressing gratitude for things in their immediate 
environment might feel awkward. That’s okay; too many of us have fallen 
into a gratitude-free way of living, which means that it’s all the more impor-
tant to push through the discomfort. Here are a few hints for enhancing the 
process as you get the hang of it:
FOCUS ON THE FEELINGS. A lot of people turn this into a mechanical 
list-making exercise or list things they “should” feel grateful for (usually a 
sign that a Brule is running the show). To avoid these pitfalls, focus on your 
feelings: happy, optimistic, comforted, confident, tender, proud, sexy, filled 
with laughter, filled with love. For each item, spend five to ten seconds let -
ting the feelings well up. When you land on something for which you truly 
do feel gratitude—whether it’s for your great child or your great skin—it 
will feel like a straight shot to bliss.
DO THESE EXERCISES TWICE A DAY, MORNING AND NIGHT. Just as 
Arianna Huffington describes her meditation system as a way to kick-start 
her morning in the right direction, taking just a moment to express grati -
tude in the morning can have an amazing impact on the rest of your day. 
Similarly, ending the day with gratitude allows you to establish a more 
positive model of reality.
SHARE THE GOODNE SS OF GRATITUDE. Think about ways to use or 
adapt these exercises with others in your life. Try them with your kids, as I 
do, or with your partner over a glass of wine at the end of the week (that’s 
happy hour for real). The benefits will be even greater if you share them, 
and hearing what others feel grateful for may inspire you to find more grat-
itude in your own life.

Blissipline System 2: Forgiveness
In Silicon Valley, the Quantified Self movement is growing in popularity. 
People known as biohackers are measuring every aspect of their being. If 
you’ve ever used a sleep app on your smartphone to gauge the quality of 
your sleep or if you’ve used wearable tech to record how many steps you’ve 
taken in a day, you’re part of the Quantified Self movement. In short, you’re 
using measurements and metrics to improve your well-being. 
Quantified Self is now coming to meditation in a big way through tradi-
tional brain wave measurement machines—but with a fascinating twist.
I recently got to experience this firsthand at the invitation of my friend 
Dave Asprey. Dave is the formidable entrepreneur behind the Bulletproof 
coffee brand and is one of the fittest, sharpest, and most intelligent peo -
ple I’ve ever met. But less than ten years ago, he told me he weighed over 
300 pounds, and his life was a mess. Dave said everything shifted when he 
experienced this new form of meditation.
I flew all the way to Victoria, British Columbia, to meet Dave and try 
out this program called 40 Years of Zen. Why the odd name? Well, the 
scientists who developed this technology studied the brain waves of many 
remarkable people—billionaires, intuitives, creatives, monks, and mystics. 
What they found was that when you meditate using these methods, your 
brain takes on the same patterns as someone who has spent twenty-one to 
forty YEARS in Zen meditation.
And so I started my journey into this program with some of the most 
remarkable people I had ever met. Our group of seven consisted of a famous 
Hollywood actor, a guy who’d just sold his company for a billion dollars, a 
top medical doctor, nutrition and fitness expert JJ Virgin, legendary mar -
keting mind Joe Polish, and Dave.
In some respects, the experience was similar to the way we use sleep 
apps to measure the quality of our sleep, but in a super-high-tech way: We 
were hooked up to some of the most cutting-edge, specialized biofeedback 
equipment to measure our brain waves. The equipment beeped different 
sounds depending on the brain waves we were producing (alpha waves, 
associated with high creativity, compassion, insight, forgiveness, and love; 
theta waves, correlated with flashes of creativity and intuition; and delta

waves, associated, we were told, with “altering reality”). We’d also see 
numbers on our screens indicating our brain wave amplitudes (higher 
amplitudes are better) and the coherence between both hemispheres of our 
brain (better coherence signifies better states of mind).
The difference between 40 Years of Zen and, say, classic meditation or 
mindfulness is simple. It’s based on actual biofeedback. When you’re med-
itating with your brain hooked up to a machine that’s recording every peak 
and trough of your brain waves, it’s easy to pinpoint exactly what works 
and what doesn’t. You can see the results of what’s going on in your mind.
Instantly.
The main focus of our sessions was to teach us how to increase our 
alpha waves, which would allow us access to higher states of creativity, a 
more relaxed mind, better problem-solving abilities, and in general many of 
the same benefits one would get from years of meditation.
All of us were making major breakthroughs. By the end of my time 
there, I was feeling a noticeable difference. In fact, my practice has never 
evolved so fast in such a short time.
As it turned out, the big secret to increasing alpha waves was just one 
thing. And we spent seven full days focusing on it.
Forgiveness.
The people behind the program discovered holding onto grudges and 
anger is the single biggest factor suppressing alpha waves. So it was critical 
for us to be able to release every last bit of that out of our systems.
Nobody mentioned forgiveness in the brochure when we signed up for 
the program. We signed up to improve our thinking and creativity skills, to 
experience deep states of meditation, to tame stress and anxiety. Yet for -
giveness gave us all of the above. We could see the results in our neurofeed-
back data.
We had to forgive every single person in our lives who had wronged us, 
even if it was in the slightest way imaginable.
I had to forgive high-school teachers, business partners, family  
members—everyone I could think of who I believed had wronged me, big 
or small.
And every time I did a round of forgiveness, my alpha waves spiked. The 
method they taught us was unbelievably effective.
For me it was timely. I had some major forgiveness to do.

Recovering from a Nightmare
Sometimes, life puts you in funny, almost ironic situations.
Just three months before attending this training, I had had one of the 
most horrible experiences in my life. I employ some 150 people in one of our 
offices. And I had discovered that someone whom I had trusted to run the 
operations and offices of the company had been skimming money from us. 
He had created fake vendors—from air-conditioning repairmen to cleaners 
and janitorial services—and then paid his own companies exorbitant sums 
to service our office. So the person I had hired to run our employee housing 
and office maintenance was in fact paying his own companies to provide 
services for our company. This was illegal and highly corrupt.
By the time he was caught, he had pocketed more than $100,000. It was 
a massive blow to me. I couldn’t believe that someone I had trusted so 
deeply could take advantage of me in this way. I had trusted this man for 
four years. I felt sick to my stomach, but I could not tell if it was from hurt 
or disgust.
Unfortunately, as painful as the discovery was, the worst was yet to 
come. When we finally fired him and filed a case against him with the 
police, he proceeded to go on a rampage to make my life difficult. From 
threats that gangsters would beat me up, to threats of my car being fol -
lowed by gang members, to disrupting our business activities by sending the 
fire department to investigate fake charges that our office was a firetrap—
he did everything he could for months to distract us from our work. It was 
a nerve-wracking time for me and my family and probably one of the most 
stressful things I’ve ever had to endure.
When we were doing the forgiveness exercises at 40 Years of Zen, I 
decided to leave him for last.
Finally, there I was in the dark chamber, meditating. Forgiving a man 
who had stolen from the company. Betrayed my trust. Threatened to hurt 
me. As I finished the exercise, I heard the machine let out a sudden beep.
I had scored my highest brain wave record.
Forgiving this man liberated me. I’d always known that forgiveness was 
extremely powerful, but never to this extent. I was also genuinely surprised 
that I was able to so thoroughly forgive him. But more than that, I felt a 
deep sense of compassion for him.

Even though I’d been plagued by the actions of this person, I believe if I 
were to see him today, I could comfortably sit down with him, have a cof -
fee, and take the time to understand him and not be unnerved or upset.
This is what is meant by the phrase, “Forgive into love.”
So, for anyone who’s looking to master Blissipline, forgiveness is key.
Exercise: Liberate Yourself and Truly Forgive
Here’s how to do a simplified variation of the forgiveness exercise I learned.
Preparation
In a notebook or on your computer, make a list of people you feel have 
wronged you or situations where you’ve been hurt. They could be recent or 
from the distant past. This may not be easy to do, especially if you’re deal-
ing with a very hurtful or long-standing situation. Be patient with yourself 
and remember that forgiveness, like happiness, is a trainable skill. In my 
own life, I have found it well worth the time and effort needed to release 
anger and hurt from my heart. When you’re ready, pick one of the people 
on the list and start the exercise.
Step 1: Set the Scene
First, with your eyes closed, for about two minutes or so, feel yourself in that 
very moment when it happened. Picture the environment. (In one of my ses-
sions, for example, I imagined my bullying school headmaster in the basket-
ball court where he had made me stand for hours in the hot sun as 
punishment.)
Step 2: Feel the Anger and Pain
As you see the person who wronged you in front of you, get emotional. 
Relive the anger and pain. Feel it burn. But don’t do this for more than a 
few minutes.
Once you bring up these emotions, move on to the next step.
Step 3: Forgive into Love
See that same person in front of you, but instead, feel compassion for him 
or her. Ask yourself: What did I learn from this? How did this situation 
make my life better?

 LIV E IN BLISSIPLINE  143
As I was doing this process, I remembered a quote from one of my 
favorite authors, Neale Donald Walsch: “[The universe] sent you nothing 
but angels.” It implies adopting a model of reality that everyone who has 
ever entered our lives, even those who have hurt us, are nothing more than 
messengers to teach us an important lesson.
Think about what lessons you could derive from this situation, as pain -
ful as it might have been. How did these lessons help you grow?
Next, focus on the person who wronged you. What pain or anguish could 
they have gone through in their life that made them do what they did?
Remember that hurt people, hurt people. Those who hurt others are 
doing it because at some level, at some time, they were hurt, too. Think 
about how they may have been hurt in their childhood or in recent years.
When I did this exercise, I saw the man who had stolen from me and 
tried to imagine him as a little boy. Perhaps he came from poverty. Perhaps 
he had an abusive parent. Perhaps his life was a constant struggle, and the 
only means of survival as a child was to steal. I don’t know the reality of his 
history, and I don’t need to know it, but it was helpful for me to imagine him 
in a situation where I could feel compassion for him rather than just anger.
This process could take a few minutes. Afterward, you should feel a 
slightly lesser negative charge toward this person. Repeat the process until 
you feel comfortable forgiving into love. For a serious offense, this could 
take hours or days. For a small offense like a minor issue with a coworker, 
five minutes may be all you need. I learned from this experience that you 
don’t have to ask the other person to forgive you. You just have to forgive 
them. And that’s completely within your control.
Now, there’s something important to distinguish here. “Forgiveness into 
love” does not mean to simply let go (in my case, to drop the charges against 
the man with the police). You still need to protect yourself and take action 
if need be. Criminal acts, especially, need to be reported to authorities.
But the pain of what happened should not eat at you.
My friend Joe Polish, who took the training with me, sent a quote he 
found on the web to me in a text message the next day:
UNFUCKWITHABLE: Whe n you’re truly at peace and in touch 
with yourself. Nothing anyone says or does bothers you and no neg-
ativity can touch you.

144 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
When you learn to truly forgive, you become unfuckwithable. Someone 
could be mean to you, and, yes, you’ll take defensive action and protect 
yourself if necessary. But you’re able to go on with your life without having 
to waste your energy on them.
The thing that truly made 40 Years of Zen the most powerful personal 
growth experience I’ve ever had was the sense of liberation I felt at the end 
of it. I had cleaned myself of so many grudges I’d held onto for years. I let 
go of painful memories I’d forgotten I had that were weighing me down. 
And I finally released the negative charges I felt against people who I 
believed had wronged me.
Today, I have never felt more at peace with myself. You can do this, too.
Blissipline System 3: The Practice of Giving
The Dalai Lama once said: To be happy, make others happy.
Giving is the path for doing this.
Giving is a natural segue from gratitude. Gratitude fills us with positive 
feelings and energy for life. When our cup is full, we have the capacity to 
give to others. Dr. Emmons’s study found that people who practiced grati-
tude were more caring. Dr. Baumeister’s research found that being a self-  
described “giver” was linked with a greater sense of meaning in life. He 
also found that meaning in life was connected with doing good things for 
other people.
Giving happiness to others is hugely powerful, lifts up both giver and 
receiver, and it’s easy, because happiness is contagious. It can be anything 
from smiling and saying good morning with gusto to leaving little notes in 
briefcases or lunchboxes; from going the extra mile on a project to doing an 
extra house chore without being asked; from leaving a thoughtful note of 
appreciation on a coworker’s desk to meeting your sweetheart at work with 
surprise tickets to an evening concert “just because.”
Giving is the path for doing this. I believe that the only currency that 
truly matters in an uncertain world is the kindness and generosity passed 
from one human being to another.
In 2012 I decided to try an experiment with giving at Mindvalley. I fre -
quently apply a method I call culture hacking to help create healthier, more 
collaborative culture in my workspaces. In culture hacking, you apply con-

sciousness engineering within a group to allow the members to grow and 
collaborate. This time I wanted to see what would happen if I created more 
appreciation and connections between coworkers. The method I decided to 
use revolved around the art of giving. Valentine’s Day was coming up, and 
I had been hearing too many singles grumbling about it. So, here’s the 
experiment that came out of that: For the week before Valentine’s Day, each 
person in the company drew a fellow employee’s name out of a hat. They 
became the secret angel of that particular “human” for the week. We gave 
each secret angel a simple instruction: Do one nice thing a day for “your” 
human for five days. Morning coffee and croissant, candy, flowers, cards, 
or just a simple note of appreciation left on someone’s desk—these are just 
a few examples of what people might give. At the end of the week, there’d 
be a big reveal, and lots of laughter and hugs all around. We called it Love 
Week.
People ended up going out of their way to organize the most spectacular 
surprises for their humans. These included elaborate lunches being cooked 
and delivered, hand-picked handicrafts, covering someone’s entire desk in 
flowers or balloons—and even once, a plane ticket to a holiday 
destination.
There was a second surprise, too. The vast majority of employees polled 
said they actually enjoyed the act of giving more than the act of receiving 
their gifts. They loved planning a daily surprise of something they knew their 
human would enjoy. If they didn’t know their human well, much of the fun 
came from finding secret ways to learn about him or her from coworkers 
and coming up with creative ideas for what to give.
The experiment was so successful that we now do it every year. By the 
end of Love Week, the entire office is buzzing with happiness. And while 
you might think that no work gets done with all this fun going on, Love 
Week is actually one of the most effective productivity hacks we do each 
year. A Gallup study of more than ten million workers found that those 
who answered yes to the statement: “My supervisor, or someone at work, 
seems to care about me as a person”  were found to be more productive, 
contributed more to profits, and were significantly more likely to stay with 
their company long term.
Giving is a powerful system for bringing bliss into your life. A compli -
ment to a coworker, a handwritten note of appreciation, inviting someone

to get ahead of you in line—all of these seemingly little things will help 
elevate your happiness while creating tiny ripples that you may not see but 
when multiplied, help us make this world a far kinder and more beautiful 
place.
Be merciless with your kindness.
Exercise: Ways of Giving
Step 1. List all the things you could give to others.
Ideas include: time, love, understanding, compassion, skills, ideas, wisdom, 
energy, physical help, and what else?
Step 2. Drill down and get specific.
What skills (accounting, tech support, tutoring, legal assistance, writing, 
office skills, art skills)? What kinds of wisdom (career counseling; work -
ing with kids; helping others deal with an experience you’ve had, such as 
going through an illness or being the victim of a crime)? What types of 
physical help (fixing things, assisting the elderly, cooking, reading to the 
blind)?
Step 3. Think about where you could give help.
within your family or extended family? At work? In your neighborhood? 
Your city? Local businesses? Spiritual community? Local library? Youth 
organizations? Hospitals or nursing homes? Political or nonprofit organiza-
tions? What about starting a group or raising awareness about an under -
served cause?
Step 4. Follow your intuition.
Review your lists and mark the items where you feel a surge of 
excitement.
Step 5. Take action.
Put out feelers, watch for coincidences that bring opportunity your way, 
and explore the possibilities.

ON YOUR WAY TO BLISSIPLINE
I’d like to tell a story from my wife, Kristina, about an encounter she had 
with one of the wisest beings living on this Earth.
Kristina worked for an NGO at the time and was a volunteer at the 
UNHCR, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Life for ref -
ugees in Asia can be abysmal, and while Kristina’s work was rewarding, it 
was also extremely stressful to see such misery on a daily basis. In her 
words, it sometimes made her “feel almost guilty about being so happy and 
fortunate in my own life.”
These issues were very much on her mind when the opportunity came 
up to ask the Dalai Lama a question while we were at that incredible con -
ference together in Calgary. Kristina asked, “How is it possible to be happy 
when seeing so much misery and tragedy every day?”
The Dalai Lama’s answer was actually a question, and it was simply 
this: “But who can you help if you’re unhappy?”
And this is perhaps one of the most important things to understand 
about Blissipline. You can be surrounded by pain. You can be empathetic 
and feel for others, but ultimately the discipline of bliss allows you to help 
spread more bliss in the world. That is the highest expression of the extraor-
dinary life.
This brings us to Law 7.
Law 7: Live in Blissipline.
Extraordinary minds understand that happiness comes from within. They 
begin with happiness in the now and use it as a fuel to drive all their other 
visions and intentions for themselves and the world.

life. I want you to wake up ten years from now and not say “What have I 
done?” but “This has been incredible—now, what’s next?”
THE DANGERS OF GOAL SETTING
Goal setting is an absurd practice that I gave up long ago. It simply is too 
dangerous when done without the right training.
See, modern goal setting, as it’s explained in countless college courses or 
to high-school kids, is really not about teaching you how to pursue what 
will really help you lead an extraordinary life. Rather, it’s about teaching 
you to pursue common Brules of the culturescape—Brules that often lead 
to your chasing things that you’ll ultimately find do not really matter. It’s 
about safety rather than about truly living.
The biggest of these Brules is the idea that you need to map out your life 
to move you toward some ridiculous idea called a career. As a result, when 
most people think about setting goals and their visions for the future, their 
dominant model focuses on career and money. Bullshit.
As Zen philosopher Alan Watts famously said:
Forget the money, because if you say that getting the money is the 
most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting 
your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go 
on living—that is, to go on doing things you don’t like doing. Which 
is stupid. Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing 
than a long life spent in a miserable way.
Too many of us pursue goals we think will make us happy—only to 
wake up one day in our forties, wondering what on earth happened to us as 
we find ourselves stuck in uninspiring, boring, stagnant lives. How does 
this happen?
First, the big problem with life in many industrialized countries is that 
far too often, we’re expected to choose a career before we can legally buy a 
beer. As a nineteen-year-old college student, I was supposed to choose and 
pursue a career in computer engineering before I even knew what I truly 
loved. It took years of increasing misery and the drama of getting fired 
from Microsoft before I figured out what a rut I’d dug myself into. There is

a fundamental flaw in our modern system of goal setting: With our minds 
clouded by Brules, we confuse the means and the end.
CHOOSE END GOALS; SKIP MEANS GOALS
You’ve probably heard the expression “it was a means to an end.” It applies 
to goals, too. Often people confuse means goals with end goals. We choose 
college majors, career paths, life paths as if they were ends in themselves, 
when in reality they’re a means to an end . We may invest years of toil and 
money for means goals masquerading as end goals. This can get us into 
trouble. The difference between a means goal and an end goal is one of the 
lessons that I wish more people could learn earlier in life. End goals are the 
beautiful, exciting rewards of being human on planet Earth. End goals are 
about experiencing love, traveling around the world being truly happy, con-
tributing to the planet because doing so gives you meaning, and learning a 
new skill for the pure joy of it.
End goals speak to your soul. They bring you joy in and of themselves, 
not because they confer any outward label, standard, or value attached by 
society. Nor are end goals undertaken for the purpose of pay or for material 
reward. They are the experiences that create the best memories in our lives.
My most amazing end goals were:
 ■ Reaching the top of Mount Kinabalu and gazing down at the clouds 
below me as the sun rose over the island of Borneo.
 ■ My honeymoon with Kristina in Svalbard, Norway, hiking through 
blizzards in Arctic weather.
 ■ Inviting my employees to witness a gorgeous, state-of-the-art new 
steampunk office I’d been dreaming up for years, and witnessing the 
look of awe on their faces when we opened the doors for the first time.
 ■ Seeing my baby daughter dance for the first time (to Billy Ray Cyrus’s 
“Achy Breaky Heart”).
But for most of my life, I pursued means goals. Means goals are the 
things that society tells us we need to have in place to get to happiness. 
Almost everything I wrote down as a goal was actually a means to an end, 
not an end in itself, including:

 ■ Graduating from high school with a good GPA.
 ■ Qualifing for the right college.
 ■ Securing a summer internship.
 ■ Getting a job at Trilogy Software in Austin, Texas.
Other common means goals include hitting certain income levels, get -
ting good reviews and promotions to a certain level at work, and being with 
one particular someone.
But when means goals become your focus, you miss the point.
I love this advice from author Joe Vitale: “A good goal should scare you 
a little and excite you a lot.” Scary and exciting are two beautiful feelings 
that good end goals often bring out. Scary is a good thing because it means 
you’re pushing your boundaries—that’s how you take steps toward the 
extraordinary. Excitement signifies that your goal is genuinely close to your 
heart—not something you’re doing to please someone else or to conform to 
society’s Brules.
THE DAY I QUIT
My wake-up call happened in 2010. I had made a promise to myself that if 
I ever woke up two weeks in a row dreading going to work, I should quit 
and think of another job. In 2010 for the first time, I felt that dread.
Mindvalley was a different company back then, and I ran it with Mike, 
my cofounder and college friend from the University of Michigan. Mindval-
ley was a venture builder, a small start-up spinning off different small web 
businesses with the goal of generating revenue. We had launched several 
e-commerce stores, a software algorithm for calculating the quality of a 
blog post, and even a social bookmarking engine that we had sold.
Mike and I were both good at what we did, but our friendship had long 
ended and working together no longer had that certain spark. While Mind-
valley ran on its own, I was pursuing other business ventures, and so was 
Mike. One of my goals was to start and exit a start-up, so I could notch 
another entrepreneurial win on my belt. And I was close. My second 
start-up, a daily deals site for Southeast Asia, was picking up steam and had 
just received a healthy round of venture capital funding. I was running two 
businesses at once, and according to my goal list, I should have been happy:

 ■ Fast-growing business. Check.
 ■ Funding. Check.
 ■ Press and media attention. Check.
 ■ Money. Check.
 ■ Titles and rewards. Check.
Yet I wasn’t happy. I was bored at work. I hated what I did and dreaded 
going to the office. I felt lonely. When most of your friends are your busi -
ness partners or employees and you dislike your work, friendships suffer, 
too. Mindvalley existed to generate cash flow but not to fulfill any grand 
meaning for me or contribute to humanity.
How had things gotten this way?
I was bending reality: I had been happy, and I had visions pulling me 
forward. And I had become wildly successful and wealthy. But while I had 
hit all my goals as an entrepreneur, something was missing.
I had inadvertently fallen into the trap of confusing means goals with 
end goals. I had ended up as an entrepreneur with a business and cash in the 
bank. I was my own boss. But I had not bothered to set true end goals that 
went beyond this.
So, what did my heart truly crave?
 ■ I wanted to be able to travel to exotic countries and beautiful loca -
tions around the world.
 ■ I wanted to be able to stay at five-star hotels with my family and expe-
rience luxury.
 ■ I wanted to be able to travel with my kids and expose them to unique 
learning opportunities.
 ■ I wanted to have friends from all around the world who were amazing 
men and women driven by humanity-focused values and doing big 
things in the world.
 ■ I wanted to meet many of the business and personal growth legends 
who had inspired me.
 ■ I wanted to be able to teach and put down on paper my personal 
growth models for the world.
 ■ And I wanted my job to be spectacular fun.

154 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
In 2010 I wrote down these goals. It was no longer just about start-ups, 
making money, and growing a business. I wanted a life that was enjoyable 
and meaningful.
Something interesting happens when you give your mind a clear vision. 
Whether the goal is a means goal or an end goal—your mind will find a 
way to bring it to you. This is why I say that to the untrained mind, goal 
setting can be dangerous. You could end up somewhere you don’t want to 
be. But when you learn about end goals and their significance and do the 
exercise I’ll share in this chapter, you’re more likely to end up with what 
your heart and soul really crave.
When I made that list, I had no idea how those goals were going to come 
about. But the human mind, driven by an exciting vision, can be an amaz -
ing force for change. Sometimes the path to your end goal can be unex -
pected. It certainly was in my case.
Bored, lonely, and thirsting for meaning and adventure, I was definitely 
experiencing one of those life dips we’ve talked about in earlier chapters. 
And in the depths of those doldrums, I got the crazy inspiration to start a 
festival.
While attending a lot of seminars to invest in my growth, I had been 
turned off by how many hosted dodgy speakers pitching shady, get-rich-
quick models under the guise of personal growth. But I was inspired by 
events that brought together tribes of like-minded souls for networking and 
learning. I had been invited to speak at events like Summit Series and loved 
the tribal dynamics I saw as people connected with each other outside the 
seminar room. How could I make these better?,  I thought.
I was speaking on stage in Washington, DC, sharing some of the ideas 
in this book. At the end of my speech, I asked the audience if anyone wanted 
to come and spend a weekend with me exploring these ideas further. I had 
no date and no event plan—yet sixty people expressed interest. I invited 
them to a room and asked them what they would like to experience. What 
I learned was that people wanted to understand more about my unique mod-
els for personal growth, and they wanted to do it with a curated tribe, in a 
fun, paradise location. “This is going to be awesome,” one of them said. 
“I like the word,” I replied. “Let’s call this Awesomeness Fest for now.” 
Then and there, with no date or location, I sold $60,000 worth of tickets. I 
now had seed funding.

Over the next several months, I put together the “fest.” I invited several 
amazing speakers, including hotelier Chip Conley, MBA professor Sriku -
mar Rao, Summit Series founder Elliott Bisnow, plus a host of fitness 
experts, and other speakers. Working with just my assistant, Miriam, we 
planned an entire event for 250 people in Costa Rica. It was a wild 
success.
We later renamed it A-Fest—and that’s how it started. Now every year 
thousands of people from forty-plus countries apply for limited tickets to 
two A-Fests happening somewhere on the planet. I, along with a roster of 
world-class speakers and trainers on different aspects of human perfor -
mance, share our latest learnings on personal growth onstage, with themes 
like Biohacking, Brain and Body, and Belief Hacking. In the evenings the 
guests experience spectacular adventures and parties that bring people 
together to connect and create profound memories.
We rent space at some of the most spectacular spots in the world, from 
paradise islands in the Caribbean to castles in Europe to world-class cul -
tural spots in Bali. We bring in music, art, and other elements to create 
environments where people connect so deeply that best friendships, mar -
riages, and business partnerships are formed. And in the midst of all this, 
I have some of the most incredible fun and adventure I can imagine—and 
get to share it with hundreds of extraordinary people who become new 
friends.
A-Fest grew and grew. It has become one of the most exciting things I 
do. Yet it fits in no category or box. But here’s the beautiful thing—it ful -
fills all the goals I set that were missing in my life at that time:
 ■ Friendship. Check.
 ■ Being able to stay in amazing hotels. Check.
 ■ Traveling to wonderful locations around the world. Check.
 ■ Exposing my children to amazing minds and learning opportunities. 
Check.
 ■ Meeting experts and business legends whom I admire. Check.
 ■ Spectacular fun. Double check.
A-Fest was never a goal in itself. Rather, it emerged as an evolution  of

all the items on my bucket list coalescing, merging, dancing with each 
other, and pointing me toward the creation of a model of reality that was 
completely new in the world.
And that’s the most important aspect of end goals. They help take you 
off the beaten path and move you away from the restrictive models of real-
ity, systems of living, and Brules that school and society prod you into fol -
lowing. End goals help you step off the treadmill of the ordinary and get on 
a trajectory toward the extraordinary.
Today, 80 percent of my closest friends in the world are people I met at 
A-Fest. And it was just one thing in my life that emerged from focusing on 
end goals. But other things happened, too.
I sold my second business. It was making me miserable. I off-loaded 
shares to a friend and got out. The money was not worth it.
I decided I would either leave Mindvalley or remake it into something I 
felt proud of. And if my business partner and I did not get along, one of us 
would need to leave. Since I had started the company and felt it close to my 
heart, I decided to buy him out. I went into debt to pay him millions of dollars 
to buy back every share. By 2011, I owned my company again. I was broke—
but I was happy. Fueled by this happiness, I grew the company 69 percent in 
one year, and I’ve not looked back since.
Correcting the way I set goals helped me shift my life from a mundane 
and tiresome slog to a life of adventure and meaning. I only wish I had 
learned about the idea of end goals sooner—I wouldn’t have wasted so 
many years pursuing goals that seemed great on the outside but that con -
tributed little to what my heart felt was important.
So, don’t choose a career, lest you end up in a mind-numbing occupa -
tion. Nor should you just declare that you want to be an entrepreneur—lest 
you turn into a stressed out, bored one. Instead, think of your end goals 
and let your career or creation find you.
Now, how do you know if you’re on the right path? Here’s how you can 
check whether your goals are means goals or end goals.
THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:  
MEANS GOALS VERSUS END GOALS
It’s a simple distinction, really, with four hallmarks to watch for.

HOW TO IDENTIFY MEANS GOALS
1. M EANS GOALS USUALLY HAVE A “SO” IN THEM. Means goals 
don’t stand alone but are stepping-stones to something else. They’re 
part of a sequence. For example: Get a good GPA so you can get 
into a good college. This often means that goals get strung together 
into (life) long sequences, like this one: Get a good GPA so you can 
get into a good college, so you can get a good job, so you can make 
lots of money, so you can afford a nice house, car, etc., so you’ll 
have money saved to do all the stuff you really want to do after you 
retire. Does your goal have a “so” attached?
2. M EANS GOALS ARE OFTEN ABOUT MEETING OR CONFORMING 
TO BRULES. Is your goal one you think you “should” meet as part of 
achieving your ultimate goal—for example, thinking that you should 
get a college degree in order to have a fulfilling job or that you should 
get married in order to have love in your life? Many means goals are 
cleverly concealed Brules. You do not have to get married. Or get a 
college degree. Or be an entrepreneur. Or join the family business. 
What you really want is to be in beautiful loving relationships, to 
have consistent opportunities to learn and grow, and to have 
freedom. These can come in many different forms. See the difference?
HOW TO IDENTIFY END GOALS
1. E ND GOALS ARE ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR HEART. Time flies 
when you’re pursuing them. You may work hard toward these goals, 
but you feel it’s worth it. They remind you of how fantastic it is to be 
human. When you’re working on an end goal, it doesn’t feel like 
“work.” You could be doing it for hours on end, but it genuinely 
makes you happy or gives you meaning. You don’t need to step away 
to get “recharged.” Working on the end goal itself recharges you—it 
doesn’t drain you. For example, for me, writing this book is an end 
goal. It’s so much fun that I’d do it even if I never got paid.
2. E ND GOALS ARE OFTEN FEEL INGS. To be happy, to be in love, to 
consistently feel loving, to consistently feel joyous are all very good 
end goals. A diploma, an award, a big business deal, or other

158 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
achievements can certainly bring good feelings, but they are not end 
goals UNLESS you’re happy AS you’re pursuing them—in other 
words, unless the act of studying for your diploma or closing the 
business deal itself brings you happiness. End goals have happiness 
baked into the pursuit.
THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
How do we avoid the means goals trap? I developed this improved 
goal-setting technique to get you there. I call it the Three Most Impor -
tant Questions. When these questions are asked in the correct order, this 
exercise can help you jump straight to the end goals that really matter in 
your life.
I’ve found that all end goals fall into three different buckets.
The first is experiences. No matter what you believe about humanity’s 
origins, one thing is clear. We’re here to experience all the world has to 
offer—not objects, not money, but experiences. Money and objects only 
generate experiences. Experiences also give us happiness in the now, a key 
component of the extraordinary life. We need to feel that daily life holds 
wonder and excitement to sustain our happiness—which fuels our move -
ment toward our goals.
The second is growth. Growth deepens our wisdom and awareness. It 
may be growth we choose or growth that chooses us. Growth makes life an 
endless journey of discovery.
The third is contribution. It is what we give back from the wealth of our 
experiences and growth. What we give is the special mark we can make on 
the world. Giving moves us toward awakening, the highest level of happi -
ness, by providing meaning in our lives, and it is a key component of the 
extraordinary life.
Think about these three essentials framed as questions.
THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
1. What experiences do you want to have in this lifetime?
2. How do you want to grow?
3. How do you want to contribute?

As you do the Three Most Important Questions exercise later in this 
chapter, you’ll see how the Twelve Areas of Balance that you’ve been explor-
ing and developing in chapters throughout this book match perfectly with 
the Three Most Important Questions. In fact, I derived the Twelve Areas of 
Balance from these questions. The graphic below shows how and where 
they fit.
Let’s play out these questions in more detail. I suggest you read through 
the process and finish this chapter (which ends with tips for doing the exer-
cise). Then do the exercise when you feel ready.
Question 1: What Experiences Do You Want to Have?
In this section, you are asking yourself this question:
If time and money were no object and I did not have to seek 
anyone’s permission, what kinds of experiences would my 
soul crave?
Let’s apply this to the first four items in the Twelve Areas of Balance. 
Each of these four items relates to experiences:
Your Love Relationship
Your Friendships
Your Adventures
Your Environment
Your Health and Fitness
Your Intellectual Life
Your Skills
Your Spiritual Life
Your Career
Your Creative Life
Your Family Life
Your Community Life
Experiences
Growth
Contribution

160 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
1. YOUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP. What does your ideal love relationship 
look like? Imagine it in all its facets: how you communicate, what 
you have in common, the activities you do together, what a day in 
your life together looks like, what holidays are like, what moral and 
ethical beliefs you share, what type of wild passionate sex you are 
having.
2. YOUR FRIENDSHIPS. What experiences would you like to share 
with friends? Who are the friends you’d share these experiences 
with? What are your ideal friends like? Picture your social life in a 
perfect world—the people, the places, the conversation, the 
activities. What does the perfect weekend with your friends look 
like?
3. YOUR ADVENTURES. Spend a few minutes thinking about people 
who’ve had what you consider to be amazing adventures. What did 
they do? Where did they go? How do you define adventure? What 
places have you always wanted to see? What adventurous things 
have you always wanted to do? What kinds of adventures would 
make your soul sing?
4. YOUR ENVIRONMENT. In this amazing life of yours, what would 
your home look like? What would it feel like to come back to this 
place? Describe your favorite room—what would be in this 
wonderful space? What would be the most heavenly bed you can 
imagine sleeping in? What kind of car would you drive if you 
could have any car you wanted? Now imagine the perfect 
workspace: Describe where you could do your best work. When 
you go out, what kinds of restaurants and hotels would you love 
to visit?
Question 2: How Do You Want to Grow?
When you watch how young children soak up information, you realize how 
deeply wired we are to learn and grow. Personal growth can and should 
happen throughout life, not just when we’re children. In this section, you’re 
essentially asking yourself:

In order to have the experiences above, how do I have to 
grow? What sort of man or woman do I need to evolve into?
Notice how this question ties to the previous one? Now, consider these 
four categories from the Twelve Areas of Balance:
5. YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS. Describe how you want to feel and 
look every day. What about five, ten, or twenty years from now? 
What eating and fitness systems would you like to have? What 
health or fitness systems would you like to explore, not because you 
think you ought to but because you’re curious and want to? Are 
there fitness goals you’d like to achieve purely for the thrill of 
knowing you accomplished them (whether it’s hiking a mountain, 
learning to tap dance, or getting in a routine of going to the gym)?
6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL LIFE. What do you need to learn in order to 
have the experiences you listed above? What would you love to 
learn? What books and movies would stretch your mind and tastes? 
What kinds of art, music, or theater would you like to know more 
about? Are there languages you want to master? Remember to 
focus on end goals—choosing learning opportunities where the joy 
is in the learning itself, and the learning is not merely a means to an 
end, such as a diploma.
7. YOUR SKILLS. What skills would help you thrive at your job and 
would you enjoy mastering? If you’d love to switch gears 
professionally, what skills would it take to do that? What are 
some skills you want to learn just for fun? What would make you 
happy and proud to know how to do? If you could go back to 
school to learn anything you wanted just for the joy of it, what 
would that be?
8. YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE. Where are you now spiritually, and where 
would you like to be? Would you like to move deeper into the 
spiritual practice you already have or try out others? What is your 
highest aspiration for your spiritual practice? Would you like to 
learn things like lucid dreaming, deep states of meditation, or ways 
to overcome fear, worry, or stress?

Question 3: How Do You Want to Contribute?
In keeping with His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s message, as I mentioned 
earlier, if you want to be happy, make other people happy. This question 
explores how all of your unique experiences and growth can help you con -
tribute to the world. It doesn’t have to be a big dramatic gesture—perhaps 
it’s inviting the new neighbors over for a cookout or taking the new hire out 
for lunch, playing the piano at a nursing home, helping rescued animals get 
adopted, or spearheading a clothing drive at work.
In this section, you’re essentially asking yourself:
If I have the experiences above and have grown in these 
remarkable ways, then how can I give back to the world?
Again, notice how this question connects to the previous two. Imagine 
what you can give in these areas of the Twelve Areas of Balance:
9. YOUR CAREER. What are your visions for your career? What level 
of competence do you want to achieve and why? How would you 
like to improve your workplace or company? What contribution 
to your field would you like to make? If your career does not 
currently seem to contribute anything meaningful to the world, 
take a closer look—is that because the work is truly meaningless 
or does it just not have meaning to you? What career would you 
like to get into?
10. YOUR CREATIVE LIFE. What creative activities do you love to do or 
what would you like to learn? It could be anything from cooking to 
singing to photography (my own passion) to painting to writing 
poetry to developing software. What are some ways you can share 
your creative self with the world?
11. YOUR FAMILY LIFE. Picture yourself being with your family not as 
you think you “should” be but in ways that fill you with happiness. 
What are you doing and saying? What wonderful experiences are 
you having together? What values do you want to embody and pass 
along? What can you contribute to your family that is unique to 
111-168_152510_CEM_P3.indd   162 3/4/16   1:19 PM

you? Keep in mind that your family doesn’t have to be a traditional 
family—ideas along those lines are often Brules. “Family” may be 
cohabiting partners, a same-sex partner, a marriage where you 
decided not to have children, or a single life where you consider a 
few close friends as family. Don’t fall into society’s definition of 
family. Instead, create a new model of reality and think of family as 
those whom you truly love and want to spend time with.
12. YOUR COMMUNITY LIFE. This could be your friends, your 
neighborhood, your city, state, nation, religious community, or the 
world community. How would you like to contribute to your 
community? Looking at all of your abilities, all of your ideas, all of 
the unique experiences you’ve had that make you the person you 
are, what is the mark you want to leave on the world that excites 
and deeply satisfies you? For me, it’s reforming global education for 
our children. What is it for you?
This brings us to Law 8.
Applying the Three Most Important Questions  
to Work, Life, and Communities
You can do the Three Most Important Questions exercise alone or with 
others. Schools in the United States and in villages in Africa have used it to 
inspire students. Companies use it to create more bonding and employee 
engagement. Many people do this exercise with a partner—sharing your 
answers creates instant connection. Try the exercise with your partner on 
your respective birthdays or on your anniversary. It’s fascinating to see how 
your own and others’ goals evolve and change over time.
Law 8: Create a vision for your future.
Extraordinary minds create a vision for their future that is decidedly their 
own and free from expectations of the culturescape. Their vision is focused 
on end goals that strike a direct chord with their happiness.

Blueprints for the Soul
The Three Most Important Questions exercise is so important that we do 
it with every person who joins the Mindvalley family. New hires go through 
a training in consciousness engineering, following a curriculum similar to 
this book. They end their induction by doing the Three Most Important 
Questions exercise. On a piece of letter-size paper, they draw three columns 
marked Experiences, Growth, and Contribution. Within the columns, they 
write down their visions and aspirations for each of the three areas. In the 
end, the sheet looks like this:
These are more than just sheets of paper to me. Each represents the 
dreams, ambitions, and motivations of someone who has joined our com -
pany. And so we lovingly call these sheets “blueprints for the soul.”
We post everyone’s blueprint, along with their photo, on a giant cork -
board so we can see and share our dreams. Each floor in our office has a 
corkboard with the blueprints of the people who work there. Seeing all of 
those shining aspirations collected in one place gives off indescribable 
power. It’s one of the most beautiful things to behold at Mindvalley—the 
collective dreams of hundreds of employees on one giant wall.

It’s also the ultimate in transparency: Coworkers know what drives 
other coworkers. Managers know what drives their team members. I know 
what drives everyone, and they know what drives me.
Many success stories started as blueprints on this wall. Amir joined 
Mindvalley from Sudan. He did the exercise when he was twenty-two, and 
he had big dreams. He wrote about how he wanted to be a professional 
speaker and write a book. Those were incredibly bold dreams considering his 
circumstances, but by age twenty-six, Amir had scratched off most of them. 
He’d written that book: My Islam: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind—
And Doubt Freed My Soul, which Foreign Policy magazine recommended as 
one of the twenty-five must-read books of 2013. Today he writes, consults, 
and speaks at top-tier venues, from Google to Columbia University.
Luminita Saviuc joined our team from Romania. On her list she wrote 
goals such as “be a world-renowned author and speaker” and “be a world 
leader in the field of spirituality.” The goals came to her in the most inter -
esting way. She had written a blog post called “15 Things to Give Up to Be 
Happy” on her personal blog PurposeFairy.com. Somehow a year later the 
post resurfaced and went viral on Facebook. It touched a nerve and 1.2 mil-
lion people shared it. Within months she got a book deal. Two big goals 
checked off.
These stories are not unusual. Time and time again I would see the big 
goals being checked off in the most unusual ways.
Best of all, this model is an opportunity for growing and giving: We can 
look at the board, see what others are doing, and say, “I love that!” and add 
it to our own blueprint. After all, there is no monopoly on dreams.
The wall also allows collaboration on shared visions. Mariana, a product 
manager from Ukraine who worked for us, dreamed of going to Nepal to 
hike the Himalayas. She scoured the wall for others who had Nepal on their 
blueprints and found three others. All four took a week off to hike in Nepal, 
bonding as they supported each other in striking an item off their list.
Talking openly about your dreams and end goals helps to make them a 
reality. It’s rare that people confide their dreams—or even admit them to 
themselves. The Three Most Important Questions exercise brings dreams 
to light for the universe—that’s you, me, and the mysterious beyond. That’s 
what makes the Three Most Important Questions exercise one of the most 
powerful ideas in this book.

166 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
As a bonus tip, remember that once you know the blueprint for your team 
members or a family member, you can always practice giving by offering them 
simple little gifts or reminders to help them grow. Over time, I developed a 
simple management technique that I consider one of the most important tools 
I use as a leader. I take a picture on my smartphone of every employee’s Three 
Most Important Questions sheet and carry it with me. I then read their blue-
prints and surprise them with a book to help them achieve their dream. For 
example, one recent new hire had written that she dreamed of learning public 
speaking and someday giving a TEDx talk. I bought her a copy of Talk Like 
TED and wrote a little note of appreciation inside the book. Something mag-
ical happens when you do this at work. You aren’t just showing that you 
care—you are making someone totally light up as they recognize that their 
dreams are supported by others. It’s a great way to build trust. Meaningful 
gestures need not be expensive; they simply need to be genuine.
Exercise: Ask Yourself the Three Most 
Important Questions
BEGIN BY KEEPING IT SIMPLE. All you need is a place to write down your 
responses—it could be your journal, your computer, a smartphone, or any -
thing else. For each category, set a timer or your watch for three minutes or 
so. Setting a timer helps shut down your logical mind so your intuitive and 
creative mind can come out to play before hairy old Brules or outdated 
models of reality can rear up and rain on your parade. With the timer, you 
can complete the entire exercise in ten minutes.
DON’T OVERTH INK IT. Trust your intuition to know the answers to 
these questions. Don’t spend too long, and don’t worry about being gram-
matical. Just let your words flow. Draw pictures if that helps. This is why the 
three-minute timer works. It forces your logical mind to shut up so your 
intuitive mind can be allowed a free-flowing expression of what you truly 
want. You can always go back after the three minutes are up and spend time 
analyzing and sorting out your list. But start with the three-minute rule.
REMEMBER T HE D IFFERENCE BETWEEN A M EANS GOAL AND AN 
END GOAL. The quickest way is to focus on feelings. What feelings will a 
goal bring? For example, a feeling-focused end goal about your environ -
ment might be: “I want a house I’m blissfully happy to wake up in every 
morning” or “At least twice a month, I get to go out for a delicious meal 
with friends or family I love to be with.”

FOLLOW THESE FIVE STEPS TO STAY ON TRACK. Use this quick guide 
to double-check your goals to see if they’re in full alignment with what you 
really want. Mia Koning, our chief facilitator at A-Fest, designed these five 
steps, which added further clarity to the process:
1. Identify a goal.
2. Answer this question exhaustively until you have no more answers:
When I achieve this goal, I will be able to __, __, __, [etc.].
3. Answer this question exhaustively, until you have no more answers:
When I achieve all this, I will feel __, __, __ [etc.].
4. Identify the true underlying objectives of your goal, based on your 
answers to questions 2 and 3.
5. Compare these objectives with the original goal and ask:
 ■ Is this original goal the only way/best way to achieve these 
objectives?
 ■ Is this original goal enough to achieve them?
 ■ Can I achieve them in a more effective way?
When you do this, you will often find that what you think is an end goal 
is really a means goal. You will also get clarity on what the actual end goal 
might be. This will free you to ensure that you’re really pursuing the right 
end goal.
WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR LIST. Stick it up on a wall where you can see 
it and keep consciously and subconsciously working toward your goals. Share 
it with others for all the reasons I mentioned. You’ll be empowering others to 
grow and giving yourself new opportunities to grow as well. I cannot express 
how powerful this is as an exercise for companies. It’s one of the most impor-
tant exercises for cultivating great culture at Mindvalley, and thousands of 
companies are doing the same. Why not introduce it to your workplace?
THE GOOD NEWS
The good news is that you’re already on your way. Something amazing 
happens when you set big, beautiful end goals. Your brain latches on to 
what you’re seeing and feeling. It goes to work, hacking its way toward 
your goals. Steve Jobs said it wisely:

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect 
them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will some-
how connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your 
gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots 
will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow 
your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path; and that 
will make all the difference.
When you ask the Three Most Important Questions right, you’re 
“believing that the dots will connect down the road.” You will start notic -
ing and discovering the paths that bring you closer and closer to where you 
want to be. Scientists may call this one thing (such as the brain’s reticular 
activating system); mystics may call it another (the universe, God, fate, 
synchronicity, the law of attraction, or thoughts create reality). Steve Jobs 
calls it “your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.”
I call it the extraordinary mind.
Use this weapon wisely.

Questions, Mindvalley has produced several short videos that you can

CHANGING THE WORLD
I
n Part I you learned to observe the culturescape, the world around you, 
and see it for what it is.
In Part II you learned that you get to choose the world you wish to expe-
rience. Through consciousness engineering, you can choose your own models 
of reality and systems for living and speed up your growth and awakening.
In Part III you learned about the world within and how to strike a bal -
ance between happiness in the now and having a vision for the future. 
Taken together, these abilities allow you to seemingly “bend reality.”
In Part IV I build on all of these to take you to the next level. Here you 
learn to change the world.
Extraordinary minds are not content to merely be in the world. They 
have a calling, a pull, to shift things. At this point in your journey toward 
the extraordinary, you may begin feeling an urge to shake up the culture-
scape by creating new models, new ideas, and new ways of life and living 
that move others to new places, too. You go from escaping the culturescape 
to returning to it and helping it evolve. All extraordinary minds go through 
this passage. They return to shake things up and change things.

But this is no small feat. To do it, you need to learn the final two laws.
In Chapter 9 we start with the first lesson: Be unfuckwithable. Trying 
to change the world requires a certain level of boldness and toughness.
In Chapter 10 we’ll look at finding your quest—how to know WHAT to 
change. You’ll learn that you are not alone and that there is an inner guid-
ance system that is going to come to your aid.
Finally, in the appendix, Tools for Your Journey, you’ll learn how to 
take all the systems for living I’ve shared with you and put them together in 
a daily fifteen-minute practice that allows you to bring together everything 
you’ve learned from this book.

— YODA, STAR WARS, EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH
HOW TO BE A SPIRITUAL BADASS
There is a great myth in spirituality today: that in order to be spiritual, we 
must resign ourselves from the world. In other words, to be spiritual, one 
must avoid big goals, ambitions, and wealth.
Rubbish. I believe the most spiritual people in the world today are those 
who are doing things to push the human race forward. To be extraordinary 
is to be connected to this spiritual aspect of yourself and to feel it move you 
to create, change, invent, and rattle the world.
Ken Wilber, perhaps the greatest living philosopher in the world today, 
wrote a beautiful essay on this subject called “Egolessness.”
In it, he says:
The typical person wants the spiritual sage to be less than a per -
son, somehow devoid of all the messy, juicy, complex, pulsating, 
desiring, urging forces that drive most human beings.   . . .  We want 
our sages to be untouched by them altogether. And that absence, that 
vacancy, that “less than personal” is what we often mean by 
“egoless.”
But egoless does not mean “less than personal”; it means “more 
than personal.” Not personal minus, but personal PLUS—all the nor -
mal personal qualities plus some transpersonal ones. Think of the great

yogis, saints, and sages, from Moses to Christ to Padmasambhava. 
They were not feeble -mannered milquetoasts but fierce movers and 
shakers—from bullwhips in the temple to subduing entire countries. 
They rattled the world on its own terms, not in some pie -in-the-sky 
piety; many of them instigated massive social revolutions that have 
continued for thousands of years.
And they did so, not because they avoided the physical, emo -
tional, and mental dimensions of humanness, and the ego that is 
their vehicle, but because they engaged them with a drive and inten -
sity that shook the world to its very foundations.
Ken Wilber’s profound words helped me resolve some of my own inner 
conflicts on being spiritual. I think there are many ways to be spiritual, and 
one of them is to be spirited—filled with forward -looking energy and the 
courage to challenge the status quo, like the scientists, entrepreneurs, and 
titans who are working on projects to push humanity forward. What could 
be more uplifting than that? We don’t have to choose between Buddha or 
badass. The idea is to be both. Indeed, sometimes the only way to be effec -
tive at one is to master the other.
BUDDHA OR BADASS?
There is a scene in Star Wars  where Yoda sits an angry teenage Anakin 
Skywalker down and tells him, “The fear of loss is a path to the Dark 
Side. . . . Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.” But to 
Anakin this advice seems difficult. Not only does he remain attached to his 
fear of losing his wife, but his fear grows to be the driving force in his life—
eventually turning him into Darth Vader. That scene has been much 
debated on the Internet: How could Yoda expect Anakin to not fear the loss 
of loved ones? It’s human after all.
Here is what I believe Yoda was saying.
To truly be a great warrior in the world, you must step past your 
fears. It’s inevitable that we get attached to people, to our goals, and 
fear losing them—but a true Jedi knows that attachments to people and 
goals can hinder us. It is possible to move toward a goal or to be madly 
in love with someone—without attachment. Often what we really fear is

not losing the other but losing that part of ourselves that this someone 
or something makes us feel. This happens when we attach our sense of 
self -wor th and happiness to someone or something outside of 
ourselves.
Go ahead and love well. Work hard toward a goal, but know that when 
you make your feelings of love and fulfillment come from an internal reser-
voir and not from the other person or the goal, you become much stronger. 
In fact, you may discover that you can love better and pursue your goals 
with much more ease. But it starts with a feeling within.
Before we come to finding your own particular quest—that aspect of the 
world that you can “rattle”—you first need to find your “badassery.”
This idea comes from my experiences at 40 Years of Zen, the biofeed -
back course where I discovered deep inner peace and clarity after working 
intensively on forgiveness. That feeling was one of being unfuckwithable. I 
don’t know the origin of that word. It started to appear in 2015 on the 
Internet in the form of an image accompanied by this text:
Sounds good, right?
The question is: How do we get there?
There are two models of reality that can help you get to this stage. Not 
only do they make you feel more grounded in terms of who you are but they 
also give you immense control over your state of mind and feelings.
Unfuckwithable: A Definition
When you’re truly at peace and in touch with yourself. Nothing 
anyone says or does bothers you and no negativity can touch you.
Law 9: Be unfuckwithable.
Extraordinary minds do not need to seek validation from outside opinion or 
through the attainment of goals. Instead, they are truly at peace with them -
selves and the world around them. They live fearlessly—immune to criticism 
or praise and fueled by their own inner happiness and self-love.

174 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
THE FIRST COMPONENT OF BEING 
UNFUCKWITHABLE: SELF-FUELED GOALS
What happens when you go as far as you can with end goals, when you 
keep asking the “so” question, as we discussed in Chapter 8, until you get 
to a genuine feeling you crave to consistently feel? My epiphany about this 
came in the middle of the desert in August 2014.
I was at Burning Man, the famous annual art festival in Black Rock 
City, Nevada, where people from all over the world come together in the 
desert and create a city from scratch. Thousands of structures and art 
installations are erected—a carnival of creativity, ingenuity, and culture to 
astonish the mind and senses—all burned or dismantled at the end as the 
hordes depart. More than 75,000 burners, as festivalgoers call themselves, 
attended the 2014 event. Many see it as a deeply spiritual experience.
Each Burning Man has a unique installation called the temple near the 
center of the festival. That year, it was a beautiful domed structure of wood 
panels cut in floral and nature patterns. Thousands meditated and prayed 
there daily. As night fell and the heat ebbed, a breeze sifted across the 
desert. I pedaled along the dusty, hard-packed earth as I’d done every night 
since arriving, headed for the temple where I’d sit on the soft playa sand and 
meditate among hundreds of burners.
The temple is filled with incredible, indescribable energy. Since the tem-
ple is a temporary structure, every available surface is covered with hand -
written notes expressing wishes, dreams, and odes to friends and family, 
dead or alive. The place vibrates with the concentrated power of human 
thought and emotion.
I went to the temple to reflect on my goals and my life. One night, as I 
sat in meditation, an insight hit me that would fundamentally change the 
way I selected end goals:
A good end goal is something you have absolute control over. 
No object or person can take it away from you.
I now call goals like this self-fueled end goals. For example, let’s look at 
end goals for a fictional character named Vanessa, newly married to Dan. 
Vanessa might write down this goal:

“To be madly in love with Dan.”
Is this an end goal? It might seem so—but it’s not. Why? Because the 
attainment of this goal is largely dependent on someone else. What if she 
and Dan fall out of love?
A better end goal for Vanessa might be this:
“To be consistently surrounded by love.”
The beauty of this end goal is that Vanessa controls it. It is thus 
“self-fueled.” If she and Dan have a long, healthy marriage, this goal man-
ifests. But even if the marriage doesn’t work out, Vanessa can still be sur -
rounded by love—from friends, family, a new partner—or best of all, from 
her own love for herself.
Setting expansive and truly powerful end goals like these is simple. And 
goals like these are largely within our control.
At Burning Man, I realized that when it came to love, the best end goal 
I could write for myself was not “To be in a loving relationship with Kris -
tina” or “To be close to my children,” but rather: “To be consistently sur -
rounded by love.”
This goal freed me from having to depend on others for love or to 
require it from them. I love my kids and my wife, but I cannot demand that 
they love me back, and setting goals for myself that are largely dependent 
on someone else leaves me powerless. This is true for everyone. We should 
not be attached to receiving love from someone else.
A similar idea can be applied to our relationship with our children. 
“Having a close, loving relationship with my kids” sounds like a proper end 
goal, but what if our kids decide at a certain age to move far away or they 
don’t need our closeness anymore? So I changed my family life goal from 
“To be close to my children” to: “To be the best father I can be.” Because 
that IS in my control, and it encourages me to pay attention to what my kids 
need from me on an ongoing and ever-changing basis.
When I shifted these goals, my mind’s guidance system kicked in, pull -
ing me into opportunities and situations to attain them. My relationships 
improved significantly. Neediness on my end stopped. I began to love and 
appreciate my own self at a level I never had before. Doing so freed me to 
be more loving and appreciative of others because, empowered by my own 
self-love, I stopped unfairly demanding love from others.
After much contemplation, I adjusted my goal about travel and adventure

(did I really want to experience bungee jumping or was I just conforming to 
a trend?) and replaced it with: “I will always have the most amazing and 
beautiful human experiences.”
See, I can control what I define as an amazing human experience. I can be 
in my nineties and unable to use my body with the same ease as now, but I 
can still have amazing human experiences, which might be holding my 
great-grandchild in my arms or enjoying a glass of fine whiskey with my wife.
With that new goal, I made a decision to take my family on a special 
holiday each year to experience an amazing part of the world. We’ve since 
traveled to Edinburgh, Scotland, and to New Zealand and had incredible 
experiences. But even if I can’t travel or decide I don’t want to anymore, 
with this expanded goal I can still have the most beautiful human experi -
ences simply being at home, playing with my daughter or building the latest 
Lego Star Wars toy with my son. Recently I found myself incredibly happy 
just sitting on my sofa drinking a wonderful red wine I had discovered and 
eating the most delicious chocolate (Royce Rum Raisin, if you must know) 
while watching The Daily Show on Comedy Central. It is that simple.
The third self-fueled end goal I now have is: “I am always learning and 
growing.” For a long time I’d had specific learning goals such as “Read a 
book a week.” And there’s nothing wrong with goals like that. But for me it 
had become stressful: Between managing a company with hundreds of 
employees and having two kids, I was finding less time to read. Sitting in the 
temple, I had an intuitive hit that it was time to reboot my learning goals.
It turned out that for me, reading a book a week had become a means 
goal. What I really wanted was to gain knowledge.
Once I expanded my goal, I got into experimenting with alternative 
ways of learning, such as mastermind groups, online courses, and “brain 
exchanges,” where I’d get on a sixty-minute call with a friend who was an 
expert on a topic and we’d share notes on our best practices.
When your goals change, your means of attainment change. A good 
goal can open up new and innovative ways of reaching it.
THE ULTIMATE BEAUTY OF  
SELF-FUELED END GOALS
Below are the three expanded end goals that I currently live by. Can you see 
what they all have in common?

1. I will always be surrounded by love.
2. I will always have the most amazing and beautiful human 
experiences.
3. I will always be learning and growing.
They are all directly within my own power. No one can take these away 
from me. This means no failure can stunt me. I could be homeless and 
alone, sleeping on the streets of New York City—but I can still be sur -
rounded by love because my love comes from within. I can learn and grow 
as long as I can find an old newspaper or a thrown-away book to read. I can 
even have beautiful human experiences because I can see the joy in every -
day life, even just walking through Central Park.
When you identify self -fueled end goals that put them within your 
power—you will have nothing to lose. Not love. Not learning. Not beauti -
ful human experiences. You will be free to live life on your own terms and 
to explore opportunities that might once have seemed out of reach or incon-
ceivable. Too many people stay stunted in their growth because of fear of 
loss—but when you go deep enough with this exercise, you realize that 
there is no loss. Happiness is completely within your control, and when you 
have nothing to lose, you’re free to think and dream boldly.
Replacing fear with courage is one of the key components of being 
unfuckwithable. Most people live their lives consistently bothered and wor-
ried about not being loved enough, about not succeeding fast enough, not 
being significant, not being impressive, losing the things that make us 
happy. But when you let go of the Brules that lead you to the wrong priori-
ties, look beyond your means goals and create self-fueled end goals, you’ve 
effectively bother -proofed yourself. You stop worrying about what others 
will think of you or might take from you, and you free yourself to dream 
big and be creative in other areas of your life.
When you become unfuckwithable, it doesn’t mean you’re settling for 
small goals. Instead, it means you’ve stopped setting goals for things you 
think you need to get from other people. These days, I have massive visions 
based on my Three Most Important Questions. My goals for Mindvalley 
are to create a school for humanity—to get a billion people onto a single 
education platform where adults and children can access the education they 
truly need to get to a point where they can truly be extraordinary—not just 
the industrial-age education that we currently get. It’s a big goal, and I work

long days to make it happen—but I feel peaceful where I am now simply 
because my happiness is not just tied to building a billion -dollar education 
company. That certainly fuels me and excites me—but my happiness itself 
comes from those three simple end goals that I have daily control over and 
that no one and no circumstance can take away from me.
My happiness in the now fuels my vision for the future, and that vision 
fuels my happiness, because a key part of it (love, learning, and human 
experiences) is already happening. It all connects.
I believe this is what the ancient Zen masters (and Yoda) meant by 
nonattachment to goals. They didn’t mean “do not have goals.” Have goals. 
But your happiness should not be attached to the completion of your goals. 
The feeling you get from completing those goals you can learn to generate 
now. When you realize this, the fear of loss disappears. You can explore 
every facet of your dreams. Be bold. Act fearlessly. And be happy—now.
THE SECOND COMPONENT OF  
BEING UNFUCKWITHABLE:  
REALIZING YOU ARE ENOUGH
In Chapter 4 I introduced you to Marisa Peer, the famous British hypno -
therapist and the work she did with me to help me see how my childhood 
insecurities were affecting my achievement and goal setting in my adult life.
It’s nearly impossible to go through childhood without some situation or 
person infecting you with the belief that you are not enough. Marisa Peer, in 
her much-watched A-Fest speech, calls the mental models we carry around 
that say we are not enough the “Biggest Disease Affecting Humanity.”
Because the model of reality that we are not enough is terribly painful, 
we live our lives trying to prove that we’re enough. Sometimes this can be 
an asset; for example, my drive to prove I was enough led me to a certain 
degree of entrepreneurial success.
But it’s not the optimal path, because working to disprove the model of 
not being enough has a hidden cost. That cost is that you will depend on 
others for validation.
You may come home from work and expect to be greeted or treated in a 
certain way by your spouse. If this does not happen, you feel out of sorts or 
rejected.

You may expect to be praised, noticed, or have your ideas heard by your 
boss or a superior at work. If that doesn’t happen, you decide you are not 
appreciated, not respected, or that your boss is an asshole.
Or maybe your son or daughter doesn’t call you enough, or a brother or 
sister doesn’t remember your birthday in the way you expect. Boom—the 
feeling creeps back in.
In all of these situations, chances are you won’t literally think, “I’m not 
enough.” No, the sneaky thing about this model is that if you have it, it’s 
hard to admit you have it—or even to realize that it’s there. So instead, you 
bury it and create a model of reality about the person you’re seeking valida-
tion from. Your brain’s meaning-making machine goes into overdrive and 
you decide:
 ■ My husband’s such an inconsiderate asshole sometimes.
 ■ That son of mine really doesn’t appreciate me.
 ■ My sister doesn’t care about her family—how awful of her.
 ■ My boss is an unappreciative jerk.
This is the most disempowering kind of model to have, because you’re 
blaming outside circumstances for what happens in your life. This model 
robs you of your own ability to control your life. While you can’t control 
what others do, you can control how you react to others. In order to be 
truly unfuckwithable, you need to lose your need to seek validation or love 
from others and to judge them when you perceive that they are not giving 
you what you need.
FROM HOLE TO WHOLE
When you create meaning around others’ actions or judge others who don’t 
provide what you need, chances are you’re really just compensating for a 
hole within yourself that they reminded you of. In every case, the root cause 
of this is a feeling of not being enough. So we look to others for validation, 
love, or praise and get hurt when we observe what we believe is criticism, 
judgment, or rudeness.
But remember, you’re in control of filling the hole within.
And here’s the paradox. When you plug this hole within yourself and

180 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
stop demanding that others fill it for you, you actually improve the chances 
of having the kind of great relationships you long for.
There is nothing more attractive than a person who loves himself or 
herself so deeply that their positive energy and love spill over to others and 
to the world.
BECOMING IMMUNE TO OTHERS’ 
BEHAVIORS, CRITICISM, OR JUDGMENT
You know you have a hole to plug when you find yourself feeling hurt or 
creating meaning around someone else’s action or words.
You can’t control someone else’s behavior toward you, but you can control 
your own reaction and how your meaning -making machine construes that 
behavior. The key is to override our inner desire to prove ourselves or our ten-
dency to feel as if we’re not enough without the love or validation of others.
I had such a moment as a teenager that’s funny in retrospect, but it was 
so painful at the time that I still remember it vividly today. The year was 
1990. I was fourteen, and Vanilla Ice’s hit song “Ice Ice Baby” was at the 
top of the charts. I loved that song, and like every other cool kid in school, 
I had tried my best to memorize the lyrics.
One day at recess, I spotted the group of cool kids that everyone in class 
wanted to hang out with. They were sitting around a desk rapping “Ice Ice 
Baby.” Their baseball caps were on backward, and they were snapping their 
fingers, looking as cool as teenagers in the nineties could look.
When they got to a particular verse, I knew this was my chance to prove 
I was hip. I jumped in and sang the verse. Loudly. With my rap face on.
But I sang the wrong line. The other kids stopped and stared at me. Jaws 
dropped. How dare I fudge the brilliant verses of Vanilla Ice? It was sacri -
lege. And then the cool girl in the group we were all trying to seek valida -
tion from, said: “Jeez, what a nerd.”
I walked away with my head down. Devastated. A failure. Their lack of 
validation tortured me.
Twenty-five years later I still remember that moment. It is incredible to 
think that I derived so much meaning about fitting in from knowing those 
lyrics. It makes no sense to me today (especially given Vanilla Ice’s musical 
track record), but it did then. If you think back, you’ve probably experienced

this sort of thing, too. (The funny side-effect is that today I know the entire 
lyrics of “Ice Ice Baby” by heart. I’m never ever messing that one up again.)
When you look back at the formative experiences of your life—whether 
they are the most painful or the most positive—you’re likely to find your 
meaning -making machine running on high. Someone’s words or actions 
influenced you in some way, and you created a meaning around them.
In order to be unfuckwithable, we need to be immune to such words and 
actions—to praise as well as to criticism. Every time you give someone the 
power to build you up with praise, you’re also unknowingly giving that 
person the power to destroy you with criticism. Therefore, accept praise 
and criticism as nothing more than someone else’s expressions of their mod-
els of reality. They have nothing to do with who you really are.
You were born enough. And we should be able to feel secure and com -
plete in our own skin without others having to support us. Fortunately, 
there are some powerful tools and practices to help.
EXERCISES FOR BECOMING 
UNFUCKWITHABLE
I learned the following exercises from several remarkable men and women. 
These three exercises are systems for living that you can apply to truly cre -
ate deep love for yourself, deep appreciation for who you are, and to center 
yourself and remove fear or worry. Combined, these help make you 
unfuckwithable.
Exercise 1: The Person in the Mirror  
(for Creating Self-Love)
I learned this exercise from Kamal Ravikant, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur 
and investor. He also shared this with me in a training session on my Con -
sciousness Engineering Program.
Kamal came out of a major illness and depression when he realized that 
the root of his discontent was a lack of self -love. He tells the story in his 
remarkable little book Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It.
One of Kamal’s techniques is for you to look at yourself in the mirror and 
say the words, “I love you.” Talking to yourself in the mirror is like speaking 
directly to your own soul—especially when you’re gazing at yourself in the 
169-208_152510_CEM_P4.indd   181 3/4/16   1:22 PM

eye. Have you noticed how uncomfortable it can be to really look someone 
in the eye for an extended period of time? Turns out it’s uncomfortable 
because it brings out feelings of connectedness and love.
Start by focusing on one eye. Once your gaze is fixed on that eye, repeat 
to yourself (aloud or silently) “I love you.” Do this for as long or as short a 
time that you feel is right.
Kamal suggests you do this every day. It should be a regular practice like 
going to the gym. Tie it to your habit of brushing your teeth in the morning. 
After you put down your toothbrush, get close and comfy and look at your-
self in the mirror.
I can vouch for the power of this technique. After Kamal shared it with 
me and I started practicing it, I experienced remarkably elevated feelings of 
self-love and security. In less than a week I could feel myself operating in a 
wholly new way with the people around me.
To learn more about this technique, you can watch Kamal talk about this 
model at his 2013 A-Fest speech. The video is available on www.mindvalley 
.com/extraordinary.
Exercise 2: Self-Gratitude  
(for Appreciating Yourself)
Make it a point to do the “What I Love about Myself” exercise we talked 
about in Chapter 4. This exercise is a powerful way to shut down the meaning- 
making machine. It also helps combat negative childhood indoctrination 
that might have caused you to feel unworthy.
Simply think about what it is about you as a human being that you love. 
Is it your sense of humor? Or maybe your taste in books? (Why, thank you.) 
Did you leave a big tip for your last waiter? Maybe it’s your commitment to 
daily personal growth. Or the fact that you have a good amount of cash 
sitting in a bank account. Or maybe it’s that you’re broke—but still happy. 
You can identify qualities that are big or small, but particularly if your 
meaning -making machine is working overtime, make sure you pinpoint 
three to five things every day that make you proud to be who you are.
I do this exercise daily in the morning as I wake up. Go ahead and 
express gratitude for the events of your day or the beauty of life—but 
make sure you include yourself in your inventory of life’s beauty by

expressing gratitude for all those things that make you so gosh -darned 
beautiful as a human being. See what a difference it will make in the rest 
of your day.
Exercise 3: Becoming Present  
(to Remove Sudden Fear and Anxiety)
Every now and then you might need a quick fix to get back to your unfuck-
withable state when sudden anxiety creeps in. It happens to me, too.
It was a regular family Sunday in November 2015. Halloween had just 
ended, and I had recently returned from a two -week trip with my wife and 
kids that included a visit to Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, attend -
ing A-Fest in Costa Rica, and visiting friends in Los Angeles and Phoenix. 
It was good to be home, but as I sat in a local restaurant with my family, I 
sensed something was off.
Inside my chest I felt my heart beating unnaturally fast. I felt an unu -
sual gnawing pain within. It was part fear, part anxiety. Being away for 
two weeks had its costs. I was returning to work as the CEO of a growing 
company, but I was feeling overwhelmed. Four hundred–plus e -mails were 
waiting to be answered. The manuscript for my new book—this book—
was due in two weeks. And then there were family errands, a sleeping 
baby in a stroller next to me, and an eight -year-old who needed help eat -
ing. I felt unpleasant and overstressed. I felt the weight on my shoulders of 
all the things I ought to be doing next.
Suddenly I remembered advice from my friend, the author Sonia Cho -
quette: Be present.
I took my attention away from the fears and worries. Instead, I focused 
on the leaves of the plant on the restaurant table before me. I noticed the 
subtle veins running through the leaves, observed the sunlight falling on the 
green surfaces, and used my fingers to feel the texture and pliability of the 
stem. In one minute, I felt as if I had just popped a relaxation pill. Everything 
went almost back to normal. This is the power of becoming focused on the 
present. It takes your mind off whatever stress, fear, judgment, anger, or 
frustration you’re having with the world or the people in it—and it forces 
you to remember who you are and to be present in the now.
The next time you feel an apparent urge to lose your cool, or you feel 
judged, insulted, or hurt by a loved one, remember to be present. This quick 
mental hack to autocorrect your mental state can instantly pull you out of

stress and anxiety and return you to happiness in the now.
When I interviewed Arianna Huffington, she shared a profound tip for 
how she gets present -centered. Focus on the rising and falling of your 
breath for ten seconds whenever you feel tense, rushed, or distracted. 
Arianna said:
This allows you to become fully present in your life. You know 
about the thread that Ariadne gave to Theseus so that he could find 
his way out of the labyrinth after he killed the Minotaur? The thread 
for me is my breath. Returning to it during the day, hundreds of 
times when I get stressed, when I get worried, when judgments come 
up, has been an incredible gift—and it’s available to all of us. There’s 
nobody alive who is not breathing.
THE PARADOX OF BEING 
UNFUCKWITHABLE
Shortly after filming Marisa Peer speaking at an event, Al Ibrahim, our 
cameraman, realized he had a question about this matter of being “enough,” 
so he asked Marisa about it.
In a nutshell, his question was this: If it is true that “I am enough” and 
if we don’t need to get validation or praise from others, what is the driving 
force that pushes us to do big things in the world? What would prevent us from 
just being happy couch potatoes, doing nothing but enjoying the present?
Marisa replied:
If you sit on the couch all day and do nothing, it is precisely 
because you don’t think you’re enough. You’re afraid. You’re afraid 
of failure. You’re afraid of rejection. You’re afraid that those things 
will be proof positive that you indeed are not enough. So you do 
nothing.
Marisa continued:
But if you believe that you’re enough, that’s when you take action. 
That’s when you go out and try something new. That’s when you 
169-208_152510_CEM_P4.indd   184 3/4/16   1:22 PM

apply for that job you really want. That’s when you ask for that raise. 
Because you’re enough. And even if you fail, you won’t take rejection 
personally because it’s not you—you ARE enough—so it must be 
your methods or your approach or skill or whatever—and because 
you know you’re enough, you know you can then improve those 
methods and skills and your approaches and then try again.
I found that to be a beautiful paradox: Knowing we are ENOUGH gives 
us the courage to do MORE, do BETTER, do our BEST. When we learn to 
be unfuckwithable, the biggest fears that hold so many back no longer 
bother us. We boldly pursue big dreams and goals.
But we’d be happy even if we lost all our goals and possessions because 
our end goals are self-fueled goals—feelings that we desire to have, such as 
being surrounded by love, enjoying beautiful human experiences, or learn -
ing and growing.
When you learn how to fill the holes within, and you no longer need 
outside validation to know you are enough and when you set end goals that 
come from your deepest feelings about living a meaningful life, you have 
graduated to the next level in recoding yourself and moving forward on 
your path toward the extraordinary. You’re now armed with the fortitude 
you need to take on truly massive goals—goals that change the culture-
scape itself and create a dent in the universe.
When you become unfuckwithable, it makes all the smaller problems 
meaningless. You’re no longer bothered about that date who didn’t text you 
back, the rising price of gas, or that naysaying coworker. You have more 
urgent things to worry about.
The problem with most people is that their problems 
aren’t big enough.
You don’t get bogged down by petty problems and by other people’s 
misbehaviors, grudges, and rivalries. You have no time for politicking, 
finger -pointing, pot -stirring, backstabbing, bullying, tattling, throwing 
under the bus, and other time sucks that fill the days of bored and unhappy 
people.
When you’re unfuckwithable, you rise above all of that. Instead, you’re

thinking of far bigger things—of problems to solve that could change the 
world and help others move forward. Your goal becomes to tackle these 
problems.
We call these goals “your quest.” We’ll explore them in the next 
chapter.

In Part I of this book, you became aware of how the culturescape domi -
nates many of us. You learned about how the rules of cultures—some of 
which go back thousands of years—influence who you are today. You 
learned about Brules and how to recognize and avoid them.
At Level 1, you are being controlled and shaped by the world around 
you. Life happens TO you. But as you start to expand in awareness and 
influence, you move to Level 2.
Level 2: The Awakening
At this level, in Part II, you learned that you can choose the world you want 
to live in. You take a stand and decide that you will choose to create the 
world you want to experience. Life happens as you CHOOSE. Here you start 
practicing the skill of consciousness engineering. You learn that your models 
of reality and your systems for living are the two components that determine 
who you become. You learn to swap out bad models and take on empower-
ing ones. You discover that you can create a filter so only the most empow-
ering models of the culturescape come through to you. In the process, you 
start to realize that you have the ability to do more, think bigger, and be in 
control of your own happiness. These realizations open you up to Level 3.
Level 3: Recoding Yourself
At this level, you connect with the world inside you and learn that happi -
ness in the now, combined with a vision for the future, put you in a bal -
anced state for moving powerfully toward your goals. You start to find that 
your dreams and ambitions come to you with ease. You realize that you can 
influence the world outside by changing the world inside you. You turn on 
your internal engine of power. We call this state of being “bending reality.” 
There’s a feeling of limitless opportunity. You’re shifting up to Level 4.
Level 4: Becoming Extraordinary
At this level, you feel secure and confident in your own abilities and 
strengths. You are unfuckwithable. At the same time, you start to actually

change the world around you so that you contribute to the growth and 
expansion of other human beings. You decide that you have a greater pur -
pose and role to play, and you decide to influence the world in a positive 
way. You feel a calling, a push to make the world a better place. Life hap -
pens THROUGH you.
Thus as you ascend the levels, your relationship with life changes:
First Life happens TO you.
Then Life happens as you CHOOSE.
Then Life happens FROM you.
Then Life happens THROUGH you.
At Level 4, life is working through you to cause you to give back to life. 
You become a servant to a higher calling. This calling is what we call your 
quest.
FINDING YOUR QUEST
Like a character in a computer game or a hero in an ancient tale, you’ve 
been on a path of intense learning, gathering and honing your skills and 
insights in crucial areas.
But there’s one thing left to accomplish. In every great tale that has cap-
tivated generations and stood the test of time, the hero is not a hero without 
a quest. This chapter is about finding your quest .
Make no mistake: You could remain in Level 3 and be a highly effective 
human being. But as you bend life more and more skillfully and start seeing 
the power unleashed by this new way of living and as you get used to the 
feeling of living in this heightened way, you may start to wonder if there are 
even greater uses of this power that you haven’t yet thought of.
Level 4—the level of the quest—awaits those curious and venturesome 
souls.
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE HAVE IN 
COMMON
What keeps the men and women whose stories I have shared in this 
book going and going and going, willing to take big gambles and risks?

190 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
They’re driven by a vision so big that they’re operating at a level beyond 
the conventional rules and limitations of work and life. When I think 
about the extraordinary people I know, there’s something about them 
that is inherently positive. They pour that positive energy into a mission 
they’re passionate about. Arianna Huffington is running a media 
empire, but she still pursues her calling of helping people live meaning -
ful lives and stay healthy. X Prize founder Peter Diamandis is looking to 
incentivize dramatic advances to help solve the world’s problems. Dean 
Kamen is working to bring science and technology to the forefront in the 
United States so kids will grow up to be scientists who can change the 
world. Elon Musk is set on making humanity an interplanetary 
species.
What I’ve learned from years of studying personal growth and speaking 
with many unusual thinkers and doers is this:
The most extraordinary people in the world do not have 
careers. What they have is a calling.
How do we define a calling? It’s pretty simple: A calling is your contri -
bution to the human race. It’s something that helps us leave the planet 
better for our children. It doesn’t have to be a massive new business or a 
game-changing piece of technology. It can be a book you’re working on. It 
could be dedicating your life to raising remarkable children. It could be 
working for a company with a mission to change the world in a way that 
resonates with you.
The key is that when you have this calling, work dissolves. What you’re 
doing excites you. It’s a passion; it’s meaningful. You’d probably do it for no 
money, since it’s anything but work. I once witnessed someone ask Richard 
Branson how he maintains work -life balance, and his reply was, “Work? 
Life? It’s all the same thing. I call it LIVING.” When your work becomes a 
calling, the old model of work disappears.
Amy Wrzesniewski, associate professor of organizational behavior at 
Yale University, has been studying a classification system that can help 
you recognize your orientation toward your work and attain greater job 
satisfaction.
She defines work in three ways:

1. A  JOB is a way to pay the bills. It’s a means to an end, and you have 
little attachment to it.
2. A  CAREER is a path toward growth and achievement. Careers have 
clear ladders for upward mobility.
3. A  CALLING is work that is an important part of your life and 
provides meaning. People with a calling are generally more satisfied 
with the work they do.
That’s what I’m talking about when I talk about having a calling.
Mindvalley is my calling. The mission is to touch one billion lives, put 
enlightened ideas into the world, and shake up how people live, work, and 
take care of their minds and bodies. Through Mindvalley, I’m inviting 
 others to become extraordinary through personal growth and learning—a 
personal value for myself. Education—the transmission of knowledge, 
enrichment, and power from one person to another—is a particular expres -
sion of love that I find compelling and beautiful. This mission makes my 
work deeply meaningful and makes me happy. Even in the lean start -up 
years, when I was banging away on my computer in a tiny apartment in 
New York City, I was happy because I was fulfilling my vision of spreading 
meditation to the masses. Obviously my life today is very different. But 
while there’s a limit to the rewards of money, there’s no limit to the rewards 
of having and pursuing a mission.
THE BEAUTIFUL DESTRUCTION
If you’ve been pondering and practicing what I’ve talked about in the later 
chapters of this book, you’re already on your way toward this stage.
Finding your calling starts with identifying your end goals. As you do 
the Three Most Important Questions exercise in Chapter 8 and create 
your list of experiences, growth opportunities, and contributions, you’re 
setting the stage for something magical to happen. You may not know 
exactly how to get to your end destination or even what that destination 
is. But there’s something mysterious about the human mind: Once you 
choose a destination, often the right synchronicities, opportunities, and 
people emerge in your life to get you there. Some people call this luck. I 
beg to differ. I believe luck is under our control. When you pursue the

right end goals while making sure you’re happy in the now, happiness 
unlocks the door for luck to come calling.
In fact, it often seems as if you don’t find your quest. Rather, your quest 
finds you.
The path may not be a straight line. You might have old Brules, models 
of reality, and systems for living (your own and maybe others’) to chal -
lenge or dismantle first. You may experience dips, stops, starts, and speed 
bumps. But it’s all part of the process. Those bumps are often signposts 
designed to turn you in the right direction and get you moving toward 
your calling. This recoding of your life won’t always be neat and tidy. 
Remember:
Sometimes you have to destroy a part of your life to let the 
next big thing enter.
I call this the beautiful destruction . Trust is the key that unlocks it.  I 
once asked Arianna Huffington the same questions I asked Elon Musk: 
“What makes you Arianna? If we could distill you and try to extract your 
essence, what is it that makes you you?”
Arianna replied:
I would say trust. I have an incredible trust in life. One of my 
favorite quotes is a little misquote: “Live life as though everything is 
rigged in your favor.” I really profoundly believe that whatever has 
happened in my life, including the biggest heartbreaks, the biggest 
disappointments, was exactly what was needed to help me get to the 
next stage of my own personal evolution and growth. I always had a 
sense of that, but now I believe that so profoundly. I can literally see 
the hidden blessing in every bad thing that happened.
There are names for these little nudges that move you toward your calling.
ENTER KENSHO AND SATORI
My friend Dr. Michael Bernard Beckwith, the inspiring founder of the 
Agape International Spiritual Center in Los Angeles, talks about two dif -

ferent paths to life growth: kensho and satori. Kensho is growth by pain. 
Satori is growth by awakening.
Kensho is a gradual process that often happens through the tribulations 
of life. A relationship breaks up, but you learn from it and your heart becomes 
more resilient. You lose a business, but you use the hard-earned wisdom to 
start your next one. You lose your job, but you learn who you are beyond 
your career. You suffer a health problem, but you discover personal reserves 
you didn’t know you had. Kensho is the universe giving you tough love.
Bottom line: You go through some kind of pain or difficulty through 
which you learn different ways to feel, think, and be. You might not even 
notice these changes while they’re happening. Imagine the tectonic shifts of 
the continents. We can’t see them happening, but mapped over time, it’s 
clear the world has changed.
In retrospect, you might even view these painful events as positive forces 
that pushed you to challenge beliefs and systems that were holding you back 
in ways you hadn’t realized (what we often call the blessing in disguise or 
the cloud’s silver lining). Dr. Beckwith suggests that kensho is our soul’s 
way of calling on us to grow.
Kensho was having my salary cut in half at work after I got back from 
my honeymoon. It forced me to start a side business that ended up becom -
ing Mindvalley.
Kensho was losing my US visa. It moved me to Malaysia, where I had no 
inkling of the impact I would have on entrepreneurship in that country.
Kensho was Mindvalley about to go bust in May 2008, leading me to 
discover new models for using my mind that led to a 400 percent increase 
in the company’s revenue.
In contrast, Dr. Beckwith defines satori moments as big insights that hap-
pen suddenly and change you forever. They can happen anytime, anywhere—
while you’re out in nature, listening to music or seeing inspiring art, holding 
hands with a loved one, quietly contemplating, or being in a personal growth 
situation, such as with a therapist, teacher, or healer. Once you’ve had a 
satori moment, the stuff that used to scare you or hold you back is left in the 
dust. You’ve leveled up and can operate on a whole new plane. If you were to 
plot your growth as quality of life over time, satori moments would look like 
sudden bursts upward, while kensho moments would start with a dip and 
then shoot upward as you recover and then assimilate your new learnings.

194 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
So, you see, here’s a new model for understanding the problems that 
happen to us in life. It could be that our problems are nothing more than a 
friendly universe whispering in our ear as we hike through life: “Hey, 
you’re on the wrong path. Check out the view from this angle.”
Dr. Beckwith once shared with me this little wisdom -bomb during an 
interview:
Behind every problem, there’s a question trying to ask itself.
Behind every question, there’s an answer trying to reveal itself.
Behind every answer, there’s an action trying to take place.
And behind every action, there’s a way of life trying to be born.
That new way of life trying to be born is your calling. And who knows 
how this calling might influence the world and those around you?
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
Do you choose your calling, or does your calling choose you? There is a 
model of reality emerging that suggests that the universe comes calling—
and your job is to listen.

My friend Emily Fletcher, a wonderful and vivacious meditation instruc-
tor who has spoken at Harvard Business School and at Google, told me in 
an interview this story about pop music legend Michael Jackson and the 
universe, which she refers to as “nature”:
If you watch the documentary, Michael Jackson’s This Is It, they 
interview his manager. He said that Michael used to call him all the 
time at like three, four, five in the morning. And the manager was 
saying Mike would be like, “Fireflies. We need fireflies.” And his 
manager would be like, “Michael, it’s four in the morning. We’ll talk 
about this tomorrow.” And Michael would say, “No, I need you to 
write it down. I need you to get up and write it down. Fireflies.” And 
his manager would say, “Why? We’ll talk about it tomorrow.” And 
he’s like, “If we don’t do it, Prince will.”
I like this story because to me it’s illustrating that Michael  . . . 
knew that if he didn’t take action, if he didn’t lead with creation, that 
nature would look for someone else. It’s like nature is just trying to 
create all the time, and it’s looking for people who are awake. It’s 
looking for people who are willing to raise their hands and bring 
something from the unmanifest into the manifest. And I don’t think 
that it’s choosy about who it is. It’s like, “Well, if you don’t do it, 
then fine. I’ll choose this other person.” And so this is why the more 
we create, the more of nature’s support we get. It’s like imagine that 
nature is the CEO of the company and then we’re all the employees. 
And if you’re the CEO of a company, which of your employees are 
you going to give the raise to? Which of your employees are you 
going to give more important jobs to? The one who is not executing 
on anything or the one who is creating and executing and coming in 
with new ideas every day?
Emily is saying that when a mission needs to manifest, the universe (or, 
as she calls it, nature) may knock on your door and bless you with that intu-
ition. But it’s up to you to jump on it. If you don’t, the universe will move on 
to the next person. The universe doesn’t care who’s going to change the 
world. It just wants someone who’ll seize the idea and run with it.

196 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
In the book Big Magic: Creative Living beyond Fear,  Elizabeth Gilbert 
talks about a similar phenomenon. Gilbert talks about how she would come 
up with a very specific book idea, and then something would happen in her 
life to distract her from working on the book. She’d later find the exact same 
book emerging from another writer’s mind—a writer who chose to act on it.
Gilbert writes, “I believe inspiration will always try its best to work 
with you—but if you’re not ready or available, it may indeed choose to leave 
you and to search for a different human collaborator.”
There’s even a name for this sort of occurrence. It’s called multiple dis-
covery. Gilbert describes it as:
  . . . inspiration hedging its bets, fiddling with the dials, working 
two channels at the same time. Inspiration is allowed to do that if it 
wants to. Inspiration is allowed to do whatever it wants to, in fact, 
and it is never obliged to justify its motives to any of us. (As far as 
I’m concerned, we’re lucky that inspiration talks to us at all; it’s too 
much to ask that it also explain itself.)
So, let’s say this model is true—that the universe does indeed come call -
ing. Well, then, you damn well better take those marching orders!
But here’s the insight that makes me smile. If it’s true that the universe 
does come calling and has chosen you for its grand new design, whatever 
that is, then it means that just like every great hero in legend, film, or the best 
computer games, you are literally the Chosen One for your particular quest.
Ain’t that something?

idea in further detail on www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
THE GODICLE THEORY
As you ascend the levels and get to Level 4, several unique and beautiful 
new models of reality will open up to you. I found the models below to be 
consistent in every person I interviewed for this book. Each is a unique 
approach to living, and each leads to the other:

1. Extraordinary people feel a unique connectedness and kinship to 
all life.
2. Extraordinary people are open to intuitive insights they attain 
through this connection.
3. Extraordinary people allow their intuition to lead them to a vision 
that pulls them forward.
4. As extraordinary people serve this calling, the universe blesses them 
with luck.
This feeling of being lucky reinforces their sense of connectedness and 
kinship to all life. It’s a virtuous circle because each leads to the other. The 
feeling of being lucky or blessed leads to a feeling of even greater connect -
edness with the world as you seek to share these blessings. Illustrated, it 
looks like this:
Combined, I call this model of reality the Godicle Theory. Here’s the 
idea: If there is a God, or Universe, or Life Force, or whatever we choose to 
call it, I believe that it is deeply connected with all of life and all of 
humanity.

198 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
If this is so, then we are particles of this “God.” I call these particles 
Godicles. The idea is that you, me, and every other human being on this 
planet are Godicles experiencing creation.
Whether you choose to interpret this as meaning that we are the meta -
physical essence of God or we that are made from stardust is your choice. 
Either way, it’s an empowering model of reality. (Remember, models of 
reality do not have to be scientifically true. You can take on a model as a 
philosophy if it empowers you.)
The Godicle Theory is interesting to me because of what it implies:
First, that all of us are connected, all life is connected, and we’re all in 
this together.
Second, if we’re all connected, then we’re capable of intuitive insights 
gained from this connection.
Third, there is a higher collective mind that seeks new visions for the 
betterment of itself and that picks individual Godicles to work on 
them. These Godicles experience this calling as their “quest.”
And finally, if we are particles of God, then it’s beautiful to think that 
we are endowed with certain God -like powers.
Perhaps this is why we sometimes seem to bend reality when we’re pur-
suing our quest.
All of this is, of course, just theory. It’s a personal spiritual model of 
reality that I play with. But it also comes from observation of the extraor -
dinary people I have met. They embody these ideas. You do, too. You just 
have to step outside the culturescape and go within.
Let’s look at how the elements of the Godicle Theory might play out in 
your life at Level 4.
1: You Feel a Connectedness with All Life
At this level, you start to feel a deep connectedness with the world. All of 
humanity—all cultures, all nations, and all people seem to resonate with 
you as part of one family. Ken Wilber describes this phenomenon as mov -
ing into world -centric consciousness. Simply put, people in Level 4 start 
to see past the Brules that divide them and understand that different

 EMB RA CE YOUR Q UES T 199
cultures, different religions, and different countries are not so different 
after all. We’re one species, on one planet. The only difference is what’s 
in our heads. At Level 4, you can have an ardent patriotism for your own 
country, an appreciation for your religion, but you’re equally in awe and 
respectful of other cultures, nations, and religions. Interestingly, the 
overwhelming majority of people I meet who are at Level 4 are human -
ists, not subscribing to any one world religion but instead having an 
appreciation of and reverence for humanity as a whole.
It’s important to make a qualifying statement at this point in our 
journey. Many men and women throughout history have had a sense of 
extreme mission—but rather than push humanity forward, they ended up 
starting wars, engaging in massive failed social experiments (think 
Joseph Stalin), or becoming prone to dangerous ideas such as religious 
fundamentalism. All of these have one thing in common—they viewed a 
particular idea or group of people as being superior to another group. 
This is the opposite of true connectedness, for true connectedness does 
not recognize borders, color, or other such models of differentiation. The 
truly extraordinary have reverence for humanity as a whole.
2: You Are Tapped into Intuition
Your intuition at this level becomes incredibly strong. You feel drawn to 
people or opportunities as if you had a homing beacon. You often wake up 
with amazing ideas floating around in your mind. These intuitive impulses 
seem to guide you toward the right opportunities and ideas.
I agree with Dr. Beckwith’s beautiful idea that when we’re in this state, 
the calling isn’t coming from us. It’s coming through us. I believe intuition 
is a conduit for that. This is why Blissipline is so crucial. Happiness is the 
fuel for intuition. When you’re stressed or fearful, you shut intuition down.
Thanks to intuition, when you set end goals, you don’t necessarily 
need to know HOW to attain them. Too many people trap themselves in 
the chains of realistic goals because they refuse to see beyond the HOW. 
Don’t worry about the HOW. Start with the WHAT and the WHY. 
When you know what you want to bring forth in the world and WHY 
you want it, choose it. Then take whatever action intuition guides you 
toward taking.

200 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
3: You Are Pulled by a Vision
At this level, your goals are plugged into your larger mission. A mission 
provides the fuel that keeps us going. Without a mission, work is a four - 
letter word. With a mission, work dissolves. As many mission -oriented 
workers say, their job stops being work and becomes something that adds 
to the quality of their life, rather than detracting from it.
And so traditional goals don’t motivate you; instead, you’re pulled by 
bigger visions to serve the world. Dr. Beckwith shared this insight with me 
about living with purpose:
It’s a much higher way of being. So you don’t give up goals, you 
don’t give up tasks . . . you still have them but they don’t run you. . . . 
When you are living under a goal -oriented model, you are pushed; 
you need motivation. [But] when you are living your purpose, you 
are now pulled by a vision.
At this level, you wake up every day excited about what you’re work -
ing on. It may be your day job, or it may be a volunteer project or a ven -
ture you’re working to get off the ground. Whatever it is, the calling to 
serve is strong. It drives you. It lights a fire under your ass to move. In the 
old paradigm of goals, you needed motivation to go after your goals. A 
whole industry of motivational tools has been born to support such 
efforts. But motivation is only needed when you’re chasing a Brule—a 
means goal. When you chase end goals, especially end goals related to 
your calling, you no longer need to be “motivated.” Instead, you are 
PULLED by your vision.
4: You Feel As If Luck Is on Your Side
At this level, all sorts of coincidences, synchronicities, and lucky breaks 
seem to happen to push you forward. You thus tend to be positive, enthusi-
astic, and optimistic about the world and life.
When you’re working on a goal that is out of alignment with your call-
ing, very often you will face roadblocks. This is why we sometimes fail to 
reach our goals. But think of these roadblocks as kensho  moments—as

gentle taps to get your blinders off so you can see what you’re really meant 
to be doing with your life.
Here’s a new model worth considering. Failure is often nothing more 
than good luck in disguise: the destruction of an old way of life so you can 
create the next grand vision of yourself. When you finally get on the right 
track, pointed toward that mission that life chose you for, just like the cho-
sen one of countless films, you start to find huge reservoirs of untapped 
power and support coming your way. Some people call it luck. You know 
better. You’re just another Godicle being pulled toward your quest.
This brings us to Law 10.
GETTING STARTED
When it comes to finding your mission, it helps to remember these two 
ideas from the culturescape as potential Brules that might hold you back.
Brule 1: You Have to Be an Entrepreneur
When I give talks, especially to college students, I’m struck by how many 
people think that in order to make a meaningful contribution in life, they 
have to become an entrepreneur. When I tell them, “No—you do not have 
to be an entrepreneur in order to move toward your mission,” I can almost 
hear the sighs of relief. There’s been a Brule going around in recent years 
that the greatest achievers become entrepreneurs, and employees are just 
working stiffs. Not true. I used to advocate being an entrepreneur, but I 
started questioning this Brule when I noticed that many of the best people 
I’ve hired at Mindvalley were former entrepreneurs. Sometimes they made 
this change because they started businesses solely to earn a living but dis -
covered something—the mission—was missing. Others had businesses with 
Law 10: Embrace your quest.
Extraordinary minds are motivated by a quest or calling—a drive to create 
some positive change in the world. This drive propels them forward in life 
and helps them to gain meaning and make a meaningful contribution.

an educational mission but realized that being part of a larger, more estab -
lished entity would add to their momentum, so they came onboard with us.
Many of the most important people in the world today are not entrepre-
neurs. Many leading scientists, engineers, and innovators who are changing 
the world are doing it as employees at large, well -run, mission -driven 
organizations.
Entrepreneurism is a means goal, not an end goal. The end goal is usually 
living a life of purpose, combined with the experiences that freedom and 
money can bring. But in today’s world, you can get those things by working 
for the right company. Extraordinary people focus on whatever actions they 
need to take to move their mission forward. So, instead of thinking, I have 
to become an entrepreneur so I can fulfill my mission,  focus on your mis -
sion as the end goal, and let it guide you. Start with your mission and then 
decide if it will mean becoming an entrepreneur, joining an established 
team, funding a company, or going to work for one. Don’t get stuck in the 
entrepreneur-versus-employee model. Bottom line: Entrepreneurship is not 
a goal in itself. It is the side effect of having the right end goals.
Brule 2: The Career Myth
Let’s talk about your career. Are you really in the right career for you? Too 
often, people pursue careers solely for money or titles. Both can be danger-
ous to your long -term h appiness. Getting sucked into these models can 
happen to anyone choosing a career path because they majored in a particu-
lar field in college, or their parents nudged them into it, or the culturescape 
suggests a certain career as the proper path—and not because it’s meaning -
ful to them. You could be damning yourself to soul-stealing work for years 
or decades in that kind of job.
I know that at times you may have no choice—you might have to pay the 
bills, just as I did when I took my dialing-for-dollars job. If that happens to 
you, it’s important to be doing things in other parts of your life that reflect 
movement toward a mission you believe in. In my case, for example, I 
started teaching meditation on the side because I felt it gave me the meaning 
my job did not.
But on the flip side, company jobs can get a bad rap. If you find a com -
pany that matches your mission, you can have an incredibly rewarding

career. But you must choose the right company. If working for a company 
is where you’re at or where you’re headed, here’s the main thing to look for:
Is your company a humanity-plus or a  
humanity-minus company?
I believe that the key to long -term career happiness is the ability to dif -
ferentiate between humanity-plus and humanity-minus settings. Here’s how 
I define these terms.
Humanity-minus companies are often businesses that exist solely for a 
profit motive. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it’s harder to get excited 
about your company’s mission when it’s not adding any value to the world, 
or worse, if the company is selling harmful products like junk food or is 
engaged in unsustainable practices like fossil fuels.
Other humanity-minus companies are founded on artificial demand—that 
is, selling products we don’t truly need and that might even be potentially 
harmful, but they are marketed as necessities for well-being or happiness. You 
know what I’m talking about. We see those ads on TV every day.
Humanity-plus companies, in contrast, push the human race forward. 
Some examples include companies focusing on clean, renewable energy 
sources, companies that promote healthy eating and living, or companies 
working on new ways to elevate and improve life on our planet. Ideally, these 
are the companies we should be working for, supporting, and starting.
You can work for a company in a traditional industry like airlines, 
insurance, electricity, and more, and that company might still have a pow -
erful mission that inspires you and others. Think of Southwest Airlines, for 
example—it’s a traditional industry, but they are contributing to the world 
by radically innovating on customer service and customers’ experiences 
when they fly.
Whatever your mission turns out to be—whether it’s starting your own 
business, joining a business, pursuing a cause outside of work, letting your 
creative light shine out to the world, or devoting yourself to raising amazing 
children, there’s really only one thing you need to remember:
You don’t have to save the world. Just don’t mess it up for the 
next generation.

204 THE C ODE OF THE EXTRAO RDINARY MIND
DISCOVERING YOUR QUEST
How do you get started with finding your mission?
This technique comes from my friend, author and speaker Martin Rutte, 
creator of projectheavenonearth.com. Martin suggests you ask yourself 
these three questions in order to help you identify your calling—fast. I’ve 
tested this out with people, and it’s amazing how rapidly they come up with 
a purpose or mission they might want to explore.
The first question is: Recall a time when you experienced Heaven on 
Earth. What was happening?
The second question is: Imagine you have a magic wand and with it you 
can create Heaven on Earth. What is Heaven on Earth for you?
And now the final question: What simple, easy, concrete step(s) will you 
take in the next twenty-four hours to make Heaven on Earth real?
While asking yourself these questions, what words and phrases come 
to mind? What images do you see? Write them all down. Draw pictures. 
Record yourself speaking your thoughts if that helps the ideas flow.
As you do this, pay attention to your emotional reactions. (Remember: 
True end goals tend to be feelings.) Do you feel your heart open or beat 
faster? Does your gut literally respond? Does your breath catch or deepen? 
Do you gasp with excitement? These are your first big clues to your mis -
sion. Remember the words of Steve Jobs:
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They some -
how already know what you truly want to become. Everything else 
is secondary.
Get guided: I’ve arranged with Martin Rutte to guide you through this 
process. You can access the video at www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.

people who make the news hit the jackpot fast. Not true.
I spoke to my friend Peter Diamandis, one of the most influential men 
in Silicon Valley, to ask his advice on what “makes someone extraordi -
nary.” Peter is the founder of Singularity University and the X Prize 
Foundation. He’s been hailed as one of the foremost leaders in the world 
today. Peter associates with men like Larry Page of Google and Elon 
Musk (who sits on his board)—so I asked Peter what he thought made 
these individuals, as well as himself, so successful. This is what Peter 
said:
I’ll tell you that it’s perseverance; it’s having a heartfelt passion 
and emotionally driven passion—something you want to solve on the 
planet that wakes you up in the morning and keeps you up at night. 
For other people, it might be something they despise or some injus -
tice in the world they want to solve. I know a lot of the time, doing 
anything big and bold in the world is hard, unless you have that 
emotional guiding star, that passion—most people fail by giving 
up—not by something that stops them.
Notice two things Peter mentioned. It won’t be easy. But if you have a 
passion that keeps you going, you have an edge. This is yet another reason 
why identifying your particular calling—something that ignites that pas -
sion in your mind, heart, and soul—is so important.
Peter also once told me: “If I had one superpower, it would be persis -
tence. X Prize took me ten years to get off the ground.”
Elon Musk told me something similar: “I have a high tolerance for pain.”
If you recall my story, you’ll notice a similar pattern. My failures and 
misfortunes were often just as spectacular as my successes. I took a lot of 
jobs just to keep body and soul together. My career path looked oddly ordi-
nary before a sudden burst of success in my later years.
Here’s my list of jobs at various ages. Notice how plain and simple my 
career was, and the various dips in between. I hope this list inspires you to 
know that if you’re on a dip at the moment, it may just be a kensho moment.

As we part ways for now, I hope that you see the beautiful journey wait-
ing for you. Perhaps like me, you grew up in a world where children were 
asked, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” That’s a sure setup for 
a Brule-based life. I believe that in the future we’ll instead be asking children, 
“What positive mark do you want to leave on the world in your lifetime?”
Remember that you can ask yourself that question now. It’s never too 
late.
Is there any downside? you may ask.
People might tell you that you’re crazy. They’ll worry about you. They’ll 
try to talk you out of it.

But some people will want to come play. There’s nothing more captivating 
than a person vibrant with life and passion and pursuing their calling. They 
come from having end goals that bring meaning and from being happy in the 
now. People who radiate this energy are magnetic because they’re living 
meaningful lives and helping others do the same. When you live at the level 
of extraordinary, you’ll attract others who want to live there, too. And 
together, you’ll create a better world for the generations who follow.
Your true greatness comes when you focus not on building a 
career but on finding your quest.
SO TAKE A STEP AND TRUST
I want to share some wise advice from the book Think and Grow Rich  by 
Napoleon Hill. Basically, he says that if you aren’t sure what to do, just take 
a step—a tiny baby step. When the universe calls on you, even if you don’t 
know the exact path to success—take a baby step.
Baby steps show intention. They show that you’re standing at attention 
and you received the marching orders. You may not know the optimal path 
to get where you’re bound to go, but your boots are on and you’re going. 
You may be stepping into the big wide unknown, but you’ll take the march-
ing orders anyway.
And something will come of that. You’ll get some feedback and take the 
next step. If it’s in the wrong direction, no worries. A little kensho or a 
nudge of intuition will be there to guide you. And then you’ll take another 
step, which might lead you to a person who can help or to a resource you 
didn’t even know existed.
Keep the steps as tiny as they need to be as you feel your way. One of my 
first baby steps was to register the company name Mindvalley. I had a piece 
of paper saying I owned that LLC. I didn’t have anything more than that, 
but getting that piece of paper allowed me to begin to create a vision around 
a company that at least already had a name. Baby steps are more powerful 
than you think. They telegraph your intention to the universe: “I heard you 
loud and clear. Bring it on, baby! Tell me what you need done. I’ll make it 
happen.”

Practice Transcendence: Where You Learn How 
to Integrate Key Systems from This Book into a 
Powerful Personal Practice
It seems to me, therefore, that educated people no longer 
have a right to any form of spiritual provincialism. The truths 
of Eastern spirituality are now no more Eastern than the 
truths of Western science are Western. We are merely talk-
ing about human consciousness and its possible states. My 
purpose . . . is to encourage you to investigate certain con -
templative insights for yourself, without accepting the meta -
physical ideas that they inspired in ignorant and isolated 
peoples of the past.
—SAM HARRI S, WAKING UP
WHAT IS TRANSCENDENCE?
Transcendence is the act of going beyond the physical world to embrace 
that which cannot be seen. In this book you learned about transcendent 
practices like gratitude and forgiveness. Here we’ll go deeper and create a 
structured practice around these processes. You’ve learned a ton of new 
systems for living in this book. Here’s where we bring it all together in one 
daily habit.
Often people ask me, “Vishen, what do you do daily to integrate these 
ideas—what is your daily practice?” In this section I’m going to share a 
transcendent practice that I custom-designed and use. I call it the Six-Phase.

The Six-Phase unifies several key ideas in this book into one integrated 
daily practice that spans fifteen to twenty minutes and leaves a powerful 
mark on your state of being. You can use it as a meditation, though it’s 
actually a lot more than meditation alone.
The Six-Phase is rooted in science and personal study. The Six-Phase 
will not just make you happier and less stressed but will also make you 
healthier and more powerful at living your quest. Several professional 
sports teams are currently using it as part of their mental training as are 
several major entrepreneurs.
Over the last ten years, I’ve built many of the world’s top meditation 
programs and apps, becoming one of the biggest promoters of meditation 
on the planet. I taught classes in New York and London, launched several 
meditation brands such as OmHarmonics, and my meditation app Omvana, 
which became the number-one highest-grossing health and fitness app on 
iTunes in more than thirty countries. I share this so you know I’m not just 
a dabbler in meditation. I’ve been researching and innovating on meditation 
practices for a decade. Yet the Six-Phase is NOT meditation by conven -
tional definition. I cannot stress this enough. People who get bored with 
meditation or who simply cannot meditate thrive with the Six-Phase. And 
many people who practice traditional meditation switch to the Six-Phase 
because they find that they get the same health results as meditation, but as 
a bonus they also see their performance at work and life soar. This is why 
I prefer to call it a transcendent practice rather than a meditation practice.
What I’m about to share with you is the VERY BEST approach to com-
bining transcendent practices that I’ve discovered. I’ll explain it and give 
you clear directions on how to experience it.
This practice will help you:
 ■ Make Blissipline part of your daily life and extend your happiness 
levels throughout the day.
 ■ Focus on your end goals and the steps you need to take to get there.
 ■ Become unfuckwithable by clearing out anxiety and practicing 
forgiveness.
 ■ Connect to your intuition and inner voice, find an optimal path to

your quest, and steer clear of Brules. Often during the Six-Phase, 
flashes of insight, ideas, and eureka moments will come.
 ■ Gain resilience to move past the inevitable bumps on the road to your 
calling.
And that’s just the beginning. You also get the benefits of a meditation 
practice. The sheer number of benefits of meditation are at this point so 
vast that I won’t cover them here. Just know that as of the time this book 
was published, there have been some 1,400 studies done on the benefits of 
meditation.
THE PROBLEM WITH MEDITATION
There are thousands of different styles of meditation, but they all fall into 
one of two categories: meditation methods derived from monastic practices 
and meditation practices designed for the modern human being.
All meditation is beneficial, but unless you’re a monk, you don’t want to 
meditate like one. It’s inefficient and slow. Many of these practices are still 
rooted in dogma and haven’t been updated for centuries.
According to Emily Fletcher, who founded the Ziva meditation school 
in New York City, the biggest misconception about meditation is that its 
purpose is to stop your mind from thinking. Just try to stop thinking. Dif -
ficult, huh? As Emily says, when people try that, it’s usually “the beginning 
and end of their meditation career.” She continues:
But if we go into this thinking that the point of meditation is to 
get good at life—not to get good at meditation, and if we accept the 
reality that no one can give their mind a command to stop, then it’s 
so much more innocent, so much more playful, and so much more 
enjoyable. Trying to give your mind a command to stop thinking is 
as effective as giving your heart a command to stop beating—it 
doesn’t work.
The Six-Phase draws on many different methods to bring you an opti -
mized meditation experience you can personalize to your schedule, needs,

and life. It’s rooted in science and allows you to incorporate every idea of 
this book into your life in just fifteen minutes a day. And you won’t be 
asked to clear your mind.
INTRODUCING THE SIX-PHASE
The Six-Phase is a mental hack to get you to the level of extraordinary 
faster than ever before.
Each phase of the Six-Phase is designed to enhance one of six key skills. 
The first three contribute to happiness in the now. The next three contrib -
ute to your vision for the future.
Here’s why we’re focusing on these six phases:
1. C OMPASSION. I believe that all human beings need love and 
compassion in their lives. This phase is about helping you be kinder 
toward others and kinder toward yourself. It’s a powerful self-love 
tool.
2. G RATITUDE. We may have many goals, but it’s important to 
appreciate and be happy about what we’ve accomplished thus far. 
Gratitude has a high correlation with well-being and happiness.
3. F ORGIVENESS.  Being at peace with the world and the people 
around you is one of the most effective ways to maintain Blissipline. 
Plus, it makes you unfuckwithable.

4. F UTURE DREAMS. As you learned in chapters 7 and 8, it’s hugely 
energizing to have a vision pulling you forward—a picture of how 
you want your life to unfold in the future.
5. THE PERFECT DAY. This phase gives you a sense of control over 
how life unfolds every day. It translates your future dreams into 
actionable steps.
6. THE BLESSING. We need to feel supported, resting in the knowledge 
that whatever big projects we’re setting out to do, things are going 
to be okay. This phase is about making you feel safe and supported 
in your quest.
We’ll first review each phase so you can familiarize yourself with how 
they unfold. Then I’ll share exactly how to perform each phase.
At the end of this chapter, I’ll also make available an app and a video 
you can watch that will easily guide you through this meditation anytime 
you want.
Phase 1: Compassion
This phase is about feeling connected to others and feeling a sense of kin -
ship with and kindness toward all of life, which we discussed in Chapter 
10. In this phase, you express your intention of extending greater compas -
sion and love to an ever-widening circle of humanity, starting with your 
family and friends and then widening all the way to encompass the planet. 
Compassion practices make you a better human being, and some studies 
have found that men and women found compassion or kindness to be one 
of the most attractive qualities in the opposite sex (so this might improve 
your love life, too).
Phase 2: Gratitude
Science shows that gratitude increases energy, reduces anxiety, improves sleep, 
and creates feelings of social connection—that’s why several exercises in this 
book focus on it. In this phase, just think about three things you’re grateful 
for in your personal life, three things you’re grateful for in your career, and 
three things you’re grateful for about yourself. This last one is important. 
Often we look for love from others but fail to truly love ourselves.

Phase 3: Forgiveness
As I shared in Chapter 7, forgiveness is critical to Blissipline and the peak 
states needed for extraordinary living. Here you’ll incorporate the forgive-
ness exercise from that chapter into your daily practice.
Science is now showing that forgiveness can lead to profound health 
benefits, including reduced back pain, higher athletic performance, better 
heart health, and greater feelings of happiness. One study of a small group 
of people with chronic back pain showed that those who meditated with a 
focus on moving from anger to compassion reported less pain and anxiety 
compared to those who got regular care. Another study found that forgiving 
someone improved blood pressure and reduced the workload on the heart. 
Interesting that lightening the heart of negativity should literally help it.
Research on the impact of forgiveness by Xue Zheng of Erasmus Univer-
sity’s Rotterdam School of Management showed that forgiveness makes the 
body seemingly stronger. “Our research shows that forgivers perceive a less 
daunting world and perform better on challenging physical tasks,” said 
Zheng.
In one study, participants could actually jump higher after writing an 
account of forgiving someone who had harmed them. In another study by 
Zheng, participants who were asked to guess at the steepness of a hill 
described the hill as less steep after they had written down an account of an 
incident where they had forgiven someone. In a previous chapter, I described 
my own powerful experiences with forgiveness during meditation. That’s 
why forgiveness is one of the components of the Six-Phase—it strengthens 
not only your body, but also your soul.
Phase 4: Future Dreams
Up to this point, you’ve focused on the present. In this phase, you express 
intentions for your future happiness. I credit this phase with the massive 
growth and joy I’ve experienced in my career. Years ago, I visualized the 
life I have today. Today, I visualize years ahead while still being happy in 
the now. Doing this on a daily basis seems to help my brain find the optimal 
paths to realizing my dreams.
When I’m visualizing my future life, I think three years ahead, and I

 APPENDIX  215
suggest you do the same in this phase. And whatever you see three years 
ahead—double it. Because your brain will underestimate what you can do. 
We tend to underestimate what we can do in three years and overestimate 
what we can do in one year.
Some people think that being “spiritual” means having to be content 
with one’s current life. Rubbish. You should be happy no matter where you 
are. But that shouldn’t stop you from dreaming, growing, and 
contributing.
Choose an end goal from your answers to the Three Most Important 
Questions in chapter 8 and spend a few minutes just imagining and think -
ing with joy about what life would be like if you had already attained this 
end goal.
Phase 5: The Perfect Day
Knowing what you want your life to look like three years from now, what 
do you need to do today to make this happen? This phase brings you to 
your perfect day—today—and you can see how you’d like your day to 
unfold: starting your morning alert and excited, having a great meeting 
with amazing colleagues, feeling full of ideas, nailing that presentation, 
meeting up with friends after work, having a delicious dinner with your 
mate, playing with your kid before bed.
When you see your perfect day unfolding, you’re priming your brain’s 
reticular activating system (RAS) to notice the positives. The RAS is that 
component of your brain that helps you notice patterns. In a common 
example, when you buy a new car, say, a white Tesla Model S, all of a sud-
den you start to notice more Model S cars on the roads. The same effect 
happens here. So, let’s say you imagine your lunch meeting today going 
well—great ideas, wonderful food, amazing ambiance. A few hours later, 
you’re actually at that meeting—and the waiter screws up your order. 
Because you’ve imagined a beautiful reality, your RAS is more likely to pay 
attention to the ambiance, the company, and the food than to the screw-up, 
because you told it to. You see? You’re training your brain to ignore the 
negative and embrace the positive. You don’t have to change the world. You 
just have to change what you pay attention to in the world. And that, it 
turns out, is hugely powerful.

Phase 6: The Blessing
You can do this final phase no matter what your religious or spiritual 
beliefs are. If you believe in a higher power, you imagine that you can tap 
into it, call upon it, and feel the energy of this higher power flowing down 
into you, through your head and all the way to your toes—you feel loved 
and supported. That’s it. It takes thirty seconds. If you don’t believe in a 
higher power, you can imagine that you’re rebooting yourself, fine-tuning 
yourself, or calling on your inner strength. Likewise, you feel this energy

GOING BEYOND “MEDITATION”  
WITH THE SIX-PHASE
If meditation has so many benefits, why do only about 20 million Ameri -
cans meditate daily? I asked this question of 70,000-plus followers on my 
Facebook profile, and many of you completed a survey. I found that if 
you’re not meditating daily, you’re likely to have one of the three outdated 
models of reality about meditation below. Here’s a snapshot of each and 
how the Six-Phase solves them.
1. “I’m Too Busy for This.”
I call this the busyness paradox because it simply does not make logical 
sense. It’s like saying, “I’m too hungry to eat.” People who meditate regu-
larly like Arianna Huffington, futurist Ray Kurzweil, and I all know that 
the massive beneficial impact of meditation on your productivity makes up 
for the fifteen minutes a day you might spend meditating. And that’s not 
even counting other benefits such as the extension to life span, the boost in 
creativity and problem solving, or the fact that meditation makes you hap -
pier during the day. If I start my workday without it, I’m simply not going 
to be as efficient or productive. Yet many people buy into this paradox. The 
reason is not so much that they can’t spend fifteen minutes, but that they 
are unaware of exactly how they should be meditating or what to do. The 
Six-Phase adds hours to your day by priming your mind to be more produc-
tive and efficient. It’s not worth skipping.

2. “I Can’t Do It Right.”
The issue with meditation, unlike, say, jogging, is that with jogging it’s easy 
to know if you’re doing it right. You’ve gone from point A to point B in X 
amount of time. Yet with meditation, you might feel yourself fluttering 
from thought to thought, falling asleep, getting bored, or just waiting for it 
to end. So you may conclude that meditation is ineffective, but these things 
are only happening because you’re not using the right system. The right 
system—the Six-Phase—keeps you engaged, isn’t boring, and actually gives 
you specific milestones to reach during your fifteen-minute session. It 
makes a world of difference.
3. “That ‘Clear Your Mind’ Thing Never Works 
for Me.”
There’s an old Chinese saying: “The mind is like a drunken monkey always 
jumping from tree to tree.” This is true. Do not think that you must clear 
your mind in order to meditate. This is one of the biggest myths about med-
itation. It may have been easier for hermits centuries ago to sit in a cave and 
clear their minds. They didn’t have jobs, careers, families, kids, text mes -
sages, or Facebook alerts to deal with. Our world is different, and medita -
tion needs to adapt. So I don’t advocate starting with clear-the-mind 
methods. The Six-Phase engages your mind. It can even be used for solving 
problems. If there’s a pressing problem at work or in your personal life, you 
can bring the thought of it into your meditation and turn the problem into 
a project. In this style of meditation, your mind is active—but you’re STILL 
in meditation and are reaping all the rewards of stillness.
Many intensely busy entrepreneurs and people with ADD who could 
never meditate before now do it daily, thanks to the Six-Phase and the com-
mon meditation challenges it solves. I get letters about it daily.
John Davy, a British entrepreneur who founded and sold the world’s 
largest comedy club, told me this the first time I met him:
I started doing the Six-Phase for about one hundred days straight. 
And then I felt normal, so I stopped. All of a sudden within weeks of 
stopping, my friends would come to me and go, “John, what hap -
pened? You’re all scratchy again. You’re all stressed again.” And then

I realized it. As I had been doing the Six-Phase, I was dramatically 
changing myself. When I stopped, some of the old stress and behav -
ior came back. My friends thought I was off my meds. I’m now back 
to it. And I’m not stopping again. It’s amazing.

HOW TO PRACTICE THE SIX-PHASE
There’s a lot of freedom in how to do this method, but here are some 
guidelines:
WHEN TO DO IT. T ypically it’s easiest to do it in the morning or at 
night before bed. Some people can do it in their offices. The main thing is 
to find ten to twenty minutes of uninterrupted time. I like to do it in the 
morning because it charges me up for the day. But you can do it at night if 
that works better for you: Just visualize the next day unfolding, having an 
incredible sleep, and then exploding into your day.
HOW TO SIT. You can sit any way you want. There’s no major method 
to it.
STAYING FOCUSED AND KEEPING AWAKE. A lot of people have ran-
dom thoughts during meditation, or they drift off to sleep. The Six-Phase is 
geared to the way the mind naturally works—which is to always be active. 
You don’t have to silence your mind. If a random thought arises, that’s 
okay. Just push it aside. Or maybe you can use it in a later phase. Is there a 
goal you’re excited about? Great! Save it for Phase 4: Future Dreams. Got a 
work meeting on your mind? Play it out in Phase 5: The Perfect Day. Are 
there things you’re worried about? Pour the power of The Blessing over it all.
Many people doze off during conventional meditation because it gets 
boring. You’re less likely to fall asleep during the Six-Phase because your 
mind is active. If you still have problems with this, fear not—you can 
download the audio (see opposite) and be guided through the phases.
Let’s Get Started
In this section I explain exactly what to do in each phase. If you’re doing 
this process for the first time, start slowly. Begin with Phase 1 on Day 1. On

Day 2, do Phase 1 and add Phase 2. And so on, until by Day 6, you’re doing 
the full Six-Phase Meditation.
Read the instructions below before you begin. If you’d rather listen to 
the instructions, I’ve put together a simple six-day course you can down -
load for free that will train you from Day 1 to Day 6 to master the full the 
Six-Phase. By Day 6, you’re running the full meditation. At that point you 
can continue with your practice by listening to the Six-Phase track provided 
in the final chapter of the course. The course is available at this site for this 
book’s online experience www.mindvalley.com/extraordinary.
Now, let’s explore exactly what you should do in each phase.
Phase 1: Compassion
Think of someone you truly love—a face or smile that makes your heart 
glow. For me, it’s my daughter, Eve. At the time of this writing, she’s two 
years old. Eve’s smile is a question I could spend my entire life answering. I 
start by picturing her and her smile.
As you picture your loved one—a partner, parent, child, close friend, 
mentor, or even a pet—make a mental note of the feelings of compassion 
and love that well up. This sensation becomes an anchor.
Now imagine this love as a bubble surrounding you. See yourself in a 
white bubble of love.
Now imagine this bubble expanding to fill the entire room. If there’s 
anyone else in the room, imagine their being included in your bubble of 
compassion and love.
Now imagine the bubble filling your entire house. Mentally project a 
feeling of love to everyone in that house. You could “feel” love sent to them. 
Or you could simply mentally repeat a statement such as, “I send you love 
and compassion and wish you well.”
Now imagine the bubble filling up your entire neighborhood or 
building . . . 
Your entire city . . . 
Your country . . . 
Your continent . . . 
And now the entire planet Earth.
For each, see yourself sending love and compassion to all living things 
within the bubble.

220 APP ENDIX
Don’t get hung up on how you see or feel the bubble. Just the thought of 
sending love and compassion to all the citizens of Earth is enough.
You’ve just completed the compassion phase. Now on to Phase 2.
Phase 2: Gratitude
Start by thinking of three to five things you’re grateful for in your personal 
life. It could be the fact that you have a warm bed or the fact that you have 
a terrific job. It could also be something simple, like the fact that you have 
a warm cup of coffee waiting for you in the kitchen.
Now think of three to five things you’re grateful for in your work life. 
Perhaps the easy commute you have. Or that coworker whose smile always 
lights you up. Or a boss who appreciates you.
So far, so good.
Now for the most important part. Think of three to five things you’re 
grateful for about yourself.
It could be the fact that you look so damn good in that favorite dress of 
yours. Or that you can really think on your feet in meetings. Or that you 
never forget a friend’s birthday. Or your remarkable intellect and your 
knack for picking incredible books to read.
Self-appreciation is something we all need to do in abundance.
Phase 3: Forgiveness
Forgiveness is like a muscle: The more you flex it, the stronger it gets. Get 
it strong enough and you become unfuckwithable—negative people and 
events just won’t affect you as much.
Start with the list of people or events to forgive that you made in Chap-
ter 7. Each time you do the Six-Phase, focus on just one person or event. 
Keep in mind that the person could be you. You could be forgiving yourself 
for something you did in the past that still gnaws at you.
Next, bring up in your imagination the person or event.
You will now repeat the three steps we discussed in the forgiveness exer-
cise in Chapter 7.
STEP 1 IS SET THE SCENE. Bring to mind the scene or image where you 
will do the forgiveness exercise. For example, when I was forgiving myself 
for a bad business decision that cost me millions, I imagined seeing a 
younger version of myself facing me in my office from 2005.

 APPENDIX  221
STEP 2 IS FEEL THE ANGER AND PAIN. For no more than two minutes 
(it’s okay to estimate), allow yourself to feel the pain and anger. It’s even 
okay to yell or pound a pillow. Let the emotions out, but don’t spend too 
long on this.
STEP 3 IS F ORGIVE IN TO LOVE. Practice asking the questions I men -
tioned in Chapter 7: What did I learn from this? How did this situation 
make my life better? Also remember the idea of “hurt people, hurt people.” 
Ask: What could have happened in the past to this person to cause them to 
hurt me so?
As you start asking these questions, you learn to see the situations from 
another’s perspective. The forgiveness may not come from one session, but 
no matter how grave the wrongdoing, the forgiveness can come. It just 
takes practice.
When the forgiveness comes, it often is so thorough and complete it can 
be surprising. As Khaled Hosseini wrote in the The Kite Runner:  “I won-
dered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, 
but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unan -
nounced in the middle of the night .”
And now you’ve wrapped up the first half of the Six-Phase. This seg -
ment should have taken six to fifteen minutes. I usually do it in seven. Now 
we move to Phases 4 through 6—all of which have to do with your vision 
for the future.
Phase 4: Future Dreams
Remember your answers to the Three Most Important Questions from 
Chapter 8? Here you start making use of them. Bring up one to three items 
from your list of answers.
Now just allow yourself to daydream. See yourself having the experi -
ences, growth, and ability to contribute that you wrote on your list. 
Remember to take a longer-term view—I suggest three years.
Bring in emotions. Emotions are key. If you’re seeing yourself visiting a 
new country, imagine the awe and excitement you would feel from making 
such a journey. Or imagine the pride and accomplishment you might feel as 
you easily pick up a new skill.
I like to spend three to five minutes on this phase. If you have problems 
visualizing, don’t fret. Instead of seeing the goal, think about it using a

technique called lofty questions  by author Christie Marie Sheldon. Here 
you phrase the vision that you want for yourself as a question in the present 
tense. For example: Why am I so easily able to visit incredible countries? 
Why am I so good at making, keeping, and multiplying money?  Why am I 
so successful in love?  Why am I at my ideal weight? For many people, the 
phrases are easier to do than the visualization. Or you could combine them. 
Ultimately it’s having the thought that matters. Just so you can hear the 
idea, see the idea, even smell the idea . . . and it will all work out fine.
Phase 5: The Perfect Day
Here you start with a simple question: In order for me to start achieving 
the items on my Three Most Important Questions list, what should I be 
doing today?
Now think of your day unfolding—the commute, the morning huddle 
with your team, your noon assignment, then that lunch meeting  . . . all the 
way to wrapping up at work, coming home, and meditating or reading 
before going to bed.
For each of these tiny slices of your day, imagine the moment unfolding 
perfectly. Author Esther Hicks suggests that if you’re prone to skepticism or 
negative thoughts, start with the phrase, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if 
______________”. For example, ask yourself: Wouldn’t it be wonderful if I 
had a stress-free commute, listening to my favorite songs?
Do this for every segment of your day until bedtime.
As you do this, just imagine, just pretend, that you have power over how 
your life and day will unfold. Just pretending that it’s so tends to give you 
more control and power and will lead to your having more positive experi-
ences throughout the day, even if you’re simply noticing positive experi -
ences over negative ones.
Now we come to Phase 6.
Phase 6: The Blessing
Here you imagine that there’s a higher power ready to support you on your 
quest. It doesn’t matter if you’re an atheist or what religion you subscribe to. 
Your higher power could be your cultural or mythological god, your saints or 
prophets, or even a spiritual or angelic being. If you’re an atheist, your higher 
power may simply be your own inner reserves of strength and fortitude.

Feel this higher power flow from the top of your scalp down over your 
forehead, eyes, face, neck, shoulders, arms, abdomen, hips, thighs, legs, and 
feet.
Imagine yourself protected and surrounded by a force that’s ready to 
protect you and keep you on the right path to your dreams.
Now imagine yourself thanking this higher power or energy, and see 
yourself ready to face the day.
When you’re ready, open your eyes. And you’re done.
THE RESULTS YOU SEE AND THOSE YOU DON’T
When you practice the Six-Phase, you start to reap all the benefits of med -
itation that you might read about. But since this system goes beyond just 
relaxation, you also reap the rewards of compassion, forgiveness, and much 
more.
The Six-Phase reminds you that you can be happy and peaceful—but 
that you can still be a force for positive change in the world. And that we 
should never, ever stop aiming for our beautiful dreams.
I consider the Six-Phase the most important thing I do every day. It’s the 
number-one secret to my success and the most important skill I teach. I 
cannot emphasize enough just how powerful it is. I look forward to hearing 
how it has benefited you. Write to me at hellovishen@mindvalley.com and 
share your stories and experiences.
I update and refine the Six-Phase on average every six months. (That’s 
my refresh rate for the Six-Phase.) I’m continuously experimenting and 
improving. So you might find that some older recordings of the exercise on 
the Internet may be slightly different from what’s in this book. Know that 
the most updated and current version of the exercise will always be on

TOOLS FOR YOUR 
JOURNE Y
Following the Code of the Extraordinary Mind
Here’s a list of all the laws and major exercises in the book to use as a ref -
erence guide.  
CHAPTER 1: TRANSCEND THE CULTURESCAPE
We live in two worlds. There’s the world of absolute truth—the things we 
can all agree on (fire is hot)—and the world of relative truth—the ideas, 
models, myths, and rules we’ve developed and passed from generation to 
generation. This is where concepts such as marriage, money, and religion 
reside. Relative truths aren’t true for all human beings, yet we tend to live 
by them as if they’re absolute truths. They can be incredibly empowering or 
incredibly limiting. I call this world of relative truth the culturescape.
CHAPTER 2: QUESTION THE BRULES
Many of us live according to outdated rules imposed on us through the 
culturescape. I call them Brules. A Brule is a bulls**t rule that society 
adopts to simplify its understanding of the world. To question the Brules is 
to take a step into the extraordinary.
Law 1: Transcend the culturescape.
Extraordinary minds are good at seeing the culturescape and are able to 
selectively choose the rules and conditions to follow versus those to ques -
tion or ignore. Therefore, they tend to take the path less traveled and inno -
vate on the idea of what it means to truly live.

COMMON BRULES WORTH CHALLENGING
1. THE COLLEGE BRULE.  We should get a college degree to guarantee 
our success.
2. THE LOYALTY TO OUR CULTURE BRULE. We should marry within 
our religion or ethnicity.
3. THE RELIGION BRULE. We should adhere to a single religion.
4. THE HARD WORK BRULE. We should work hard to be successful.
Exercise: The Brule Test
How can you quickly recognize a Brule? Ask yourself these five questions:
Question 1: Is it based on trust and hope in humanity?
Question 2: Does it violate the Golden Rule?
Question 3: Did I take it on from culture or religion?
Question 4: Is it based on rational choice or contagion?
Question 5: Does it serve my happiness?
CHAPTER 3: PRACTICE CONSCIOUSNESS 
ENGINEERING
Think of consciousness engineering as an operating system for the human 
mind—one that you control. Your models of reality are like the hardware: 
They’re your beliefs about yourself and the world. Your systems for living 
are like the software: what you do to “run” your life—from your daily hab -
its to how you solve problems, raise your kids, make friends, make love, and 
Law 2: Question the Brules.
Extraordinary minds question the Brules when they feel those Brules are out 
of alignment with their dreams and desires. They recognize that much of the 
way the world works is due to people blindly following Brules that have long 
passed their expiration date.

have fun. We constantly upgrade our electronic models and systems, but 
many of us live with outdated beliefs and habits without even knowing it. 
When you swap out old, expired models and systems that limit you, you’re 
elevating your consciousness and opening the path to extraordinary living.

CHAPTER 4: REWRITE YOUR MODELS OF REALITY
It’s up to us to choose what we want to believe about ourselves and our 
lives—and give our children the power to do the same. The exercises below 
will help you rewire your models of reality. Try doing them with your chil-
dren, too—and if they can’t think of something they love about themselves, 
tell them something you love about them.
Exercise: The Gratitude Exercise
Think of three to five things you’re grateful for today—they could be as 
small as a shared smile or as large as a promotion at work.
Exercise: The “What I Love about Myself” Exercise
Think of three to five things you love about yourself. Perhaps it’s a quality 
or an action that made you proud today. Or perhaps it’s your sense of 
humor, your calm in a crisis, your hair, or your jump shot. For a few min -
utes each day, acknowledge just how great that “you” is.
External Models of Reality
Our internal models of reality, or our beliefs about ourselves, are hugely 
powerful. But our external models—what we believe about the world—are 
just as powerful. Here are four of the most powerful new external models 
I’ve decided to believe have added immense value to my life:
 ■ We all possess human intuition.
 ■ There is power in mind-body healing.
 ■ Happiness at work is the new productivity.
 ■ It is possible to be spiritual but not religious.
Law 3: Practice consciousness engineering.
Extraordinary minds understand that their growth depends on two things: 
their models of reality and their systems for living. They carefully curate the 
most empowering models and systems and frequently update themselves.

the idea of activating your rational mind before you unconsciously adopt a 
model. Ask yourself the following questions:
Question 1: Is my model of reality absolute or relative truth?
Question 2: Does this really mean what I think it means?
CHAPTER 5: UPGRADE YOUR SYSTEMS FOR LIVING
Many of us are so busy doing that we never step back and think about how 
we’re doing—or why we’re doing it. Extraordinary minds are always look-
ing to discover and refresh their systems for living. Then they evaluate to 
see how well those systems are working.
How well are your systems for living serving you? Is it time to upgrade?
Exercise: What’s Your Refresh Rate?
Have you updated the systems in any of the Twelve Areas of Balance 
recently? I’ve listed the twelve areas below along with a favorite book or 
course for each that could offer a new perspective:

about themselves and powerful in shifting the world to match the visions in 
their minds.

Once you refresh your systems for living, use non-negotiable set points  
to prevent backsliding and progress toward even higher levels of 
achievement.
Step 1. Identify the areas of your life where you  
want to create set points.
Pick a couple of areas from the Twelve Areas of Balance where you’d like to 
see progress.
Step 2. Determine your set points.
Set specific achievable goals in these areas.
Step 3. Test your set points and correct if you miss.
If you slip off your set point, initiate a set-point correction procedure (see 
Step 4).
Step 4. Turn up the heat—in a good way.
When you slip off your set point, set a goal to get back to your set point—
plus a little more. Now you’ve not just prevented stagnation, you’re actually 
growing.

The Systems of the Future
We pay far more attention to systems for taking care of our bodies than to 
systems that take care of our mind and spirit. We’ve created a society 
where it’s considered normal to wake up with feelings of stress, anxiety, 
fear, and worry. But it isn’t. We can install systems for living to be free of 
them. I call these systems transcendent practices. They include gratitude, 
meditation, compassion, bliss, and other practices. Just a few minutes 
each day will clear your mind and give you energy, optimism, and clarity 
for the day ahead.
CHAPTER 6: BEND REALITY
As you start playing with consciousness engineering, questioning the Brules, 
and experimenting with new models of reality and systems for living, life 
starts to feel spacious and exciting. You’re moving toward a powerful upgrade. 
I call it bending reality. There are two key things you feel in this state:
 ■ You have a bold vision for the future pulling you forward.
 ■ You’re happy in the NOW.
Your vision is continuously pulling you forward—but it doesn’t feel like 
work. It feels like a game, a game you love to play.
Exercise: The Eight Statements
The simple set of eight statements below will help you gauge where you are 
on the path to bending reality. There are no right or wrong answers. This 
is just for you to see where you are right now.
1. I love my current job to the point where it does not feel like work.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
Law 5: Upgrade your systems for living.
Extraordinary minds consistently spend time discovering, upgrading, and 
measuring new systems for living applied to life, work, heart, and soul. They 
are in a perpetual state of growth and self-innovation.

2. My work is meaningful to me.

3. There are often moments at work that make me so happy the time just 
flies by.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
4. When things go wrong, I don’t worry at all. I just know something 
good is on the horizon.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
5. I feel excited about my future, knowing even better things are always 
on their way.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
6. Stress and anxiety don’t seem to faze me much. I trust in my ability to 
attain my goals.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
7. I look forward to the future because I have unique and bold goals on 
the horizon.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
8. I spend a good amount of time thinking excitedly about my visions for 
the future.
 N OT AT ALL TRUE S OMETIMES TRUE V ERY TRUE
If you answered “Very true” to statements 1 through 4, you are likely happy in the now.
If you answered “Very true” to statements 5 through 8, you likely have a good vision for 
your future.
If you can answer “Very true” for all eight statements, you’re likely in the state of bend -
ing reality.
Most people, however, find that they tend to be able to answer “Very true” to either the 
happiness-related statements or to the vision-related questions, but not to both.
Law 6: Bend reality.
Extraordinary minds are able to bend reality. They have bold and exciting visions 
for the future, yet their happiness is not tied to these visions. They are happy in 
the now. This balance allows them to move toward their visions at a much faster 
rate while having a ton of fun along the way. To outsiders, they seem “lucky.”

CHAPTER 7: LIVE IN BLISSIPLINE
Did you know that there’s a simple system for mastering happiness in the 
now and feeling truly joyous? I call it Blissipline: the discipline of daily 
bliss. It consists of three key systems:
Blissipline System 1: The Power of Gratitude
Blissipline System 2: Forgiveness
Blissipline System 3: The Practice of Giving
Happiness is not some amorphous state outside of your control. It’s 
a trainable skill. The exercises below are powerful pathways to 
Blissipline.
Exercise: Daily Gratitude
Most of us look toward the future when seeking happiness. But happiness 
is right in our own backyard. Focusing on the good things that have already 
happened in our lives provides instant happiness in the now. Each morning 
and evening, spend a few minutes thinking about:
Three to five things you’re grateful for in your personal life
Three to five things you’re grateful for in your work life
They can be big or small—as long as they’re meaningful to you. Spend 
five to ten seconds letting the positive feelings well up about each thing. 
Try sharing the bliss: Try doing these exercises with your kids or with 
your partner.
Exercise: Liberate Yourself and Truly Forgive
Letting go of grudges and anger is the single most powerful conduit to a 
relaxed, powerful state of mind. Like happiness, forgiveness is a trainable 
skill. It is key to mastering Blissipline. Here is a simplified variation of the 
forgiveness exercise I learned at the program 40 Years of Zen.
Preparation
Make a list of people you feel have wronged you or situations where 
you’ve been hurt. This may not be easy to do, especially for a very hurtful 
224-240_152510_CEM_ApxB.indd   233 3/4/16   1:25 PM

or longstanding situation. Be gentle with yourself. When you’re ready, pick 
one of the people on the list and start the exercise.
Step 1. Set the scene.
With your eyes closed, for two minutes or so, feel yourself in the moment it 
happened. Picture the environment.
Step 2. Feel the anger and pain.
As you picture the person who wronged you, get emotional, but don’t do 
this for more than a few minutes.
Step 3. Forgive into love.
As you picture that person, feel compassion for him or her. What pain or 
anguish might they have suffered that made them do what they did? Ask 
yourself: What did I learn from this? How did this situation make my life 
better?
Afterward, you should feel a slightly lesser negative charge toward this 
person. Repeat the process until you feel comfortable forgiving into love. 
For a serious offense, this could take hours or days. “Forgiveness into love” 
does not mean to simply let go. You still need to protect yourself and take 
action if need be. Criminal acts, especially, need to be reported to authori -
ties. But with forgiveness, the pain of what happened no longer eats at you.
Exercise: Ways of Giving
Step 1. List all the things you could give to others.
Ideas include: time, love, understanding, compassion, skills, ideas, wisdom, 
energy, physical help, and what else?
Step 2. Drill down and get specific.
What skills (accounting, tech support, tutoring, legal assistance, writing, 
office skills, art skills)? What kinds of wisdom (career counseling; work -
ing with kids; helping others deal with an experience you’ve had, such as 
going through an illness or being the victim of a crime)? What types of 
physical help (fixing things, assisting the elderly, cooking, reading to the 
blind)?

Step 3. Think about where you could give help.
Within your family or extended family? At work? In your neighborhood? 
Your city? Local businesses? Spiritual community? Local library? Youth 
organizations? Hospitals or nursing homes? Political or nonprofit organiza-
tions? What about starting a group or raising awareness about an under -
served cause??
Step 4. Follow your intuition.
Review your lists and mark the items where you feel a surge of 
excitement.
Step 5. Take action.
Put out feelers, watch for coincidences that bring opportunity your way, 
and explore the possibilities.
CHAPTER 8: CREATE A VISION FOR YOUR FUTURE
Most of us are asked to choose a career before we can legally buy a beer. 
How can we possibly know what we want from life at that age? But even 
when we try to be “mature” and systematic about goal setting, we may end 
up dissatisfied because most modern goal-setting methods are fundamen -
tally flawed.
We’re trained to set “means goals”—goals that are a means to an end—
and usually about meeting or conforming to society’s Brules. In contrast, 
“end goals” follow our heart, excite and inspire us, and put our ultimate 
target in our sights. Pursuing end goals accelerates our momentum toward 
the extraordinary. The Three Most Important Questions exercise can help 
you get straight to the end goals that really matter in your life:
Law 7: Live in Blissipline.
Extraordinary minds understand that happiness comes from within. They 
begin with happiness in the now and use it as a fuel to drive all their other 
visions and intentions for themselves and the world.

Exercise: Ask Yourself the Three Most Important 
Questions
Question 1: What Experiences Do You Want to Have?
If time and money were no object and I did not have to seek anyone’s per -
mission, what kinds of experiences would my soul crave?
 ■ YOUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP. Vividly imagine your ideal love relation-
ship. Whom do you want to wake up next to in the morning?
 ■ YOUR FRIENDSHIPS.  Picture your social life in a perfect world—the 
people, the places, the conversation, the activities.
 ■ YOUR ADVENTURES. What kinds of adventures would make your 
soul sing?
 ■ YOUR ENVIRONMENT. Conjure up the feelings of being in environ -
ments you love. What would your ideal home, car, travel destinations 
look like?
Question 2: How Do You Want to Grow?
In order to have the experiences above, how do I have to grow? What sort 
of man or woman do I need to evolve into?
 ■ YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS. Describe how you want to feel and 
look every day. What about five, ten, or twenty years from now?
 ■ YOUR INTELLECTUAL LIFE. What do you need to learn in order to 
have the experiences you listed above? What would you love to learn?
 ■ YOUR SKILLS. What skills would help you thrive at your job? If you’d 
love to switch gears professionally, what would it take to do that? 
What are some skills you want to learn just for fun?
 ■ YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE. What is your highest aspiration for your 
spiritual practice?
Question 3: How Do You Want to Contribute?
If I have the experiences above and have grown in these remarkable ways, 
then how can I give back to the world?

 APPENDIX  237
 ■ YOUR CAREER.  What are your visions for your career? What contri -
bution to your field would you like to make?
 ■ YOUR CREATIVE LIFE. What creative activities do you love to do or 
what would you like to learn? What are some ways you can share 
your creative self with the world?
 ■ YOUR FAMILY LIFE. Picture yourself being with your family, not as 
you think you “should” be but in ways that fill you with happiness. 
What wonderful experiences are you having together? What can you 
contribute to your family that is unique to you? Remember, your fam-
ily doesn’t have to be a traditional family—define “family” as those 
whom you truly love and want to spend time with.
 ■ YOUR COMMUNI TY LIFE. Your community could be your friends, 
neighborhood, city, state, nation, religious community, ethnicity, or 
the world community. Looking at everything that makes you who you 
are, what is the mark that you want to leave on the world that excites 
and deeply satisfies you?
CHAPTER 9: BE UNFUCKWITHABLE
Extraordinary minds are full of energy and are prepared to take on the 
world to manifest their bold goals and visions. If you want to do the same, 
you must step past your fears. Fortunately, like much of what you’ve learned 
in this book, becoming unfuckwithable is a trainable skill. It involves 
understanding two particular models of reality:
SELF-FUELED GOALS. These are end goals that you have absolute con -
trol over. No one can take them away from you. Example: to be con-
sistently surrounded by love.
Law 8: Create a vision for your future.
Extraordinary minds create a vision for their future that is decidedly their 
own and free from expectations of the culturescape. Their vision is focused 
on end goals that strike a direct chord with their happiness.

YOU ARE ENOUGH. Feeling that you must prove yourself will infect 
your life with the need to seek validation from the outside world. It 
gives away control over your life. Knowing that you are enough takes 
you from having a hole in your heart to being whole-hearted—and 
with your heart whole, you will have so much more to give to life, 
love, yourself, and the planet.
Exercise 1: The Person in the Mirror  
(for Creating Self-Love)
Stand before a mirror, look directly into your eyes, and repeat to yourself, 
“I love you.” Do this as many times as feels right to you.
Exercise 2: Self-Gratitude 
(for Appreciating Yourself)
Make sure you do the “What I Love about Myself” exercise every day (see 
Chapter 4).
Exercise 3: Becoming Present 
(to Remove Sudden Fear and Anxiety)
Use present-centeredness to pull yourself out of stress and anxiety and return 
to happiness in the now. Simply spend a minute or so focusing on a specific 
detail in the present moment: the way the light is falling on an object, the 
beautiful design of your own hand, or the rise and fall of your breath.
CHAPTER 10: EMBRACE YOUR QUEST
When I think about the extraordinary people I know, their uniqueness is 
that they’re driven by a vision so big that they’re operating beyond the con-
Law 9: Be unfuckwithable.
Extraordinary minds do not need to seek validation from outside opinion or 
through the attainment of goals. Instead, they are truly at peace with them -
selves and the world around them. They live fearlessly—immune to criticism 
or praise and fueled by their own inner happiness and self-love.

ventional limitations of work and life. Their energy is inherently positive, 
and they pour it into a mission that they’re passionate about.
The most extraordinary people in the world do not  
have careers. What they have is a calling.
A calling is your contribution to the human race. It’s something that 
helps us leave the planet better for our children. It can be a book you’re 
working on. It could be dedicating your life to raising remarkable children. 
It could be working for a company with a mission to change the world in a 
way that resonates with you. When you pursue a calling, your life is filled 
with passion and meaning. With the right practices, anyone can reach this 
stage of supreme fulfillment.
Discovering Your Quest
How do you get started with finding your mission? There are two 
approaches I know of: the approach for the brain and the approach for the 
heart. You can also combine both.
Author and speaker Martin Rutte, creator of projectheavenonearth.
com, suggests you ask yourself these three questions in order to help you 
identify your calling—fast.
The first question is: Recall a time when you experienced Heaven on 
Earth. What was happening?
The second question is: Imagine you have a magic wand and with it you 
can create Heaven on Earth. What is Heaven on Earth for you?
And now the final question: What simple, easy, concrete step(s) will you 
take in the next twenty-four hours to make Heaven on Earth real?
Law 10: Embrace your quest.
Extraordinary minds are motivated by a quest or calling—a drive to create 
some positive change in the world. This drive propels them forward in life 
and helps them to gain meaning and make a meaningful contribution.

THE SOCIAL LEARNING PLATFORM:

Since this book is about questioning life, as I wrote it I began questioning 
the way traditional ways books are made. One of my big annoyances with 
the idea of the “‘book”‘ in today’s world is that you cannot easily interact 
with fellow readers or with the author. For this book, I decided to fix this 
flaw. I had my team develop a social learning platform to allow authors and 
readers to interact and learn from each other. As far as I know, this is the 
first of its kind in the world. You can interact with other readers, share 
ideas, and even communicate with me directly from your phone or com -

GLOSSARY
BEAUTIFUL DESTRUCTION: A situation where a part of your life is destroyed, 
only to make way for better and bigger things to come to you.
BENDING REALITY: The idea that our consciousness can shape the world around 
us and that luck is within our control.
BLISSIPLINE: The discipline of daily bliss. The process of consciously raising one’s 
happiness level by adopting specific systems for living, including transcendent 
practices. See also Transcendent practices.
BLUEPRINT FOR THE SOUL: A person’s written answers to the Three Most 
Important Questions.
BRULE: A bulls**t rule. An element of the culturescape that an individual has 
decided to ignore or dismiss as untrue or irrelevant to that individual’s 
worldview.
BUSYNESS PARADOX: The fallacy of thinking one is too busy to meditate—
similar to saying, “I’m too hungry to eat.”
COMPUTATIONAL THINKING: A process that generalizes a solution to open-
ended problems. Open-ended problems encourage full, meaningful answers 
based on multiple variables, which require using decomposition, data 
representation, generalization, modeling, and algorithms.
CONSCIOUSNESS ENGINEERING: A method to optimize learning and hacking of 
the culturescape by gaining awareness of the models of reality and systems for 
living that may have intentionally or unintentionally been adopted from the 
culturescape.
CULTURE HACKING: The technique of changing the culture (beliefs and 
practices) of a group (as in workspace, company, family, school) by using tools 
to create positive advancements in the group culture. It’s applying consciousness 
engineering within a group to allow the members to grow and work together 
better. See also Consciousness Engineering.
CULTURESCAPE: The world of relative truth, which is made up of human ideas, 
cultures, mythologies, beliefs, and practices.
CURRENT REALITY TRAP: The state of feeling happy in the now but without a 
vision for the future. While this state may bring temporary happiness, it won’t 
bring fulfillment .
DO-DO TRAP: The condition of being so busy doing that there is no time to step 
back and think about how and why one is doing things.

END GOAL: An ultimate aim or destination—often discerned by following one’s 
heart and feelings; the opposite of a means goal. See also Means goal.
FOUR STATES OF HUMAN LIVING: Four conditions of life, each having a 
different level or balance (being pulled forward by a bold vision for the future 
and being happy in the now): 1) the negative spiral, 2) the current reality trap, 
3) stress and anxiety, and 4) bending reality.
GODICLE THEORY: The idea that human beings are particles of God and are thus 
endowed with certain God-like abilities such as the ability to bend reality.
HUMANITY-MINUS COMPANY: A business whose product may fill an 
unsustainable or artificially-created demand and that leaves the world and the 
human race worse off.
HUMANITY-PLUS COMPANY: A company that pushes the human race forward; 
for example, companies focusing on clean, renewable energy sources, 
companies that promote healthy living, or companies working on new ways to 
live on the planet.
KENSHO: A gradual process of positive personal growth that often happens 
through the tribulations of life. This positive growth may not be noticeable 
while it is happening. See also Satori.
LOFTY QUESTIONS: A method of asking positive questions during a transcendent 
practice as described by author Christie Marie Sheldon; an alternative to 
affirmations and problem-focused personal growth practices; for example, 
How am I finding so many ways to give and receive love? instead of Why 
can’t I find a love relationship?
MEANIN G-MAKING MACHINE: A syntax in the human brain that attempts to 
attach meaning to situations that often are random, have no implied meaning, 
or do not have the meaning that has been attached.
MEANS GOAL: A goal (sometimes a Brule) mistakenly identified and pursued as 
an end in itself, when in fact it is simply a means to a larger, more fulfilling 
end. See also Brule and End goal.
MODELS OF REALI TY: Beliefs about the world that play out in one’s experiences 
of the world, unconsciously or consciously; analagous to hardware in a 
computer. See also Systems for living.
NEGATIVE SPIRAL: The painful state of not being happy in the now and not 
having a vision for the future.
PRESENT-CENTEREDNESS: Becoming focused on the present as a technique for 
finding happiness in the now and raising one’s happiness set point.
REFRESH RATE: How frequently a person updates his or her systems for living.
RETICULAR ACTIVATING SYSTEM (RAS): The component of the brain that 
registers patterns; certain transcendent practices prime the RAS to notice the 
positives over the negatives in life situations.
REVERSE GAP: As explained by Dan Sullivan, the space, or gap, between the past 
and the present and the events that fill it—the best place to focus on when

practicing gratitude and a far more reliable source of happiness than focusing 
on the forward gap (anticipating happiness in the future), as most people do.
SATORI: A sudden spurt of positive personal growth that happens by awakening; a 
life-changing insight that occurs without warning and lifts a person 
immediately to a new plane. See also Kensho.
SET POINT: A non-negotiable benchmark that is easily measurable and helps you 
measure your level of growth or maintenance.
SIX-PHASE MEDITATION: A meditation program rooted in science that takes just 
fifteen minutes a day and draws on many different methods to bring

personalize to their own schedule, needs, and life.
SYSTEMS FOR LIVING: Structured habits and processes for living aspects of life, 
from play to work to growth. A repeated (and, ideally, an optimized) pattern 
for getting things done; analogous to software in a computer or apps. See also 
Models of reality.
THREE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Three pivotal questions for setting 
expansive, fulfilling goals on the path to bending reality.
TRANSCENDENT PRACTICES: Optimized systems for living that nurture the 
mind and spirit and take practitioners beyond or above the range of normal or 
merely physical human experiences. Examples include exercises in gratitude, 
meditation, compassion, and bliss. See also Blissipline.
TWELVE AREAS OF BALANCE: Twelve key domains of a balanced life: your love 
relationship, your friendships, your adventures, your environment, your health 
and fitness, your intellectual life, your skills, your spiritual life, your career, 
your creative life, your family life, your community.
UNFUCKWITHABLE: According to Internet memes: “When you’re truly at peace 
and in touch with yourself. Nothing anyone says or does bothers you and no 
negativity can touch you.”
