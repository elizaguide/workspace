hi everyone so what we're going to do over here is give you guys a couple of action steps to move into what stephen kotler calls the polyphasic life so if you think about the world today we live in a monophasic world the world tells us that there's one singular state of consciousness but if you look at indigenous cultures they lived and functioned in multi phases of consciousness polyphasic living you could call it the archwa tribe in the amazon they believe what they dream in the dream world is real and they use dreams to communicate so a crazy story but the archwa tribe um this is the tribe i wrote about in my book they called it the extraordinary mind and they were suffering because their their rainforest was being cut down by logging companies and they wanted help they went into the dream state and they projected into the dream state the cry for help my friend lynn twist who's a famous um famous um ngo leader non-government organization she had started an organization that was feeding millions of people and she had kind of completed that she was looking for new things to do and she would wake up every day with dreams of these these indigenous people with red paint on their face she couldn't figure out what it was until she was telling a friend and he says well what you're describing sounds like the achwar so he flew with her to visit the achawa tribe and it turned out that they had been calling for help and here was that help lin partnered with the achawa tribe and went on to save and preserve close to four million am i if i remember the numbers right four million acres of amazon land right that's what we mean by being able to access altered states of consciousness now it's not just indigenous tribes in the amazon think about sufis the the mystical uh element of islam they access altered states through dance think about the buddhists who access altered states through meditations um my mom who is a hindu she has a group of other women who are buddhist and hindu and they come together in this this community of maybe around 10 to 20 women and they sit together and they chant and they pray for other members of their community who might be sick or who might need some help and something really interesting happens within days these people start experiencing healings or they start seeing elements of their their health shift again this is accessing those altered states but the modern western world tells us that this is not true i was interviewing stephen kotler he says it started with the french enlightenment i mean it was an amazing aspect when we came out of the dark ages and the renaissance emerged but with that focus on science somehow we forgot to remember that our ancestors had access to these consciousness technologies in really remarkable ways that we did not bring into the modern world so the goal here and the goal of atheists here is to is to teach you guys the idea the model of reality that you can live a far more limitless life when you get to access these altered states of consciousness how many of you here would like to to start bringing this into your life immediately so what i'm going to talk about is the state that i'm most familiar with see one of the interesting thing about states of consciousness is we all experience them in our own way right so what a sufi is experiencing is different from what a tibetan monk is different from what um i might experience at 40 years of zen or you might experience during your meditation we still haven't figured out how to map and collaborate and label all of these states so sometimes we talk about the same state but we have different labels just the state of flow itself has been called by many different terms from mojo to flow to um state of limitless now the state that i'm most obsessed with is this i call it the state of limitless and i've been talking about this for almost nine years now let me try to define it it's a mental state of mind in which you are pulled forward by big goals yet happy where you are now it creates a feeling of growth and a feeling of being lucky so let me define that again okay the state of limitless is the state where you have crazy visions for yourself in the world crazy visions for how you want to grow for how you want to improve the world for how you want to leave the world better off for humanity and they're not coming from the ego these visions are not about oh you know i want to get a million bucks saved in my bank account or buy a flashy car often divisions are about pushing humanity forward it's a more it's less ego it's more us more we but at the same time your happiness isn't tied to that vision your happiness is untangled from the vision you're happy in the now while still moving towards a vision now there's some interesting things about this this quality of the state of limitless which i tried to map and label because i felt this my students felt this the first is a sense of connectedness tribe community connectedness become really really really important to you if you run a company you care about your employees the state of joy the friendships within your company matter you like events like a-fest because you get to connect wim hof said it at the pool today he said something a lot along the lines of it's no longer about individuality it's about us it's about us coming together that's one thing that you start to feel in this state human connection is really really really important it's less about the ego but that level of connectedness also extends to all life you start caring about the environment you care about the fact that you know 15 10 to 15 species are going extinct every week in the world today and you want to do something about it you sign up for gift back there you're like rebecca rebecca is one of those people who just has this huge sense of connectedness now the second thing is you're tapped into intuition you feel an impulse you feel a gut reaction you sometimes wake up in the middle of the morning and you instantly have an idea how many of you have experienced this in the morning or while you're showering these ideas flood your brain that's intuition intuition can be a powerful thing a modern world sometimes tells us to shut it off or they you know 10 years ago you couldn't talk about psychic potential you'd be considered a wacko and there were indeed lots of psychics who were scam artists today i believe the idea that we all have psychic potential within us and that we can apply it to business is becoming more and more real newark college of engineering did a study the professor's name was john mihalosky he put ceos through esp test test to test their psychic potential they found a correlation ceos who had higher psychic potential on these tests were the same ceos who were creating the biggest rises in profitability for their companies so i believe this is going to be another big field of study but when you're in that state of limitless you have that potential you are drawn to people or repulsed by some people you are drawn to ideas and you instantly sometimes know what not to focus on it's as if you have this inner guidance system now the third is this inspiration drives your intention you sometimes have difficulty with traditional goal setting because you you have start to awaken to the fact that when you do traditional goal setting you're sometimes chasing the goals that society has said you have to chase but when you're listening to your heart and your intuition you're chasing the goals that your soul or a greater power want you to chase and therefore you tend to be more dead on you don't go all the way to achieve something only to realize that you're still miserable because you were chasing something that your parents told you you had to do or society told you you had to do here's a classic example in america america has five percent of the world's lawyer of the world's population 70 of the world's lawyers and the reason for that is because since the 80s through shows like ali mcbeal and l.a law law has been glamorized in the u.s law right now is the highest starting salary if you come out as a lawyer from graduate school higher starting salary 75k in america but here's where it gets crazy numerous studies show that 50 of lawyers are clinically depressed 50 percent but why do people become lawyers anyway they are chasing a goal embedded in them by media by society no baby no child no seven-year-old goes mom and dad i want to be a lawyer it just doesn't happen so people who are in the state of limitless their intention their goals are driven by inspiration now the final element is that they feel lucky it's really bizarre luck seems to be on your side you notice synchronicities you notice coincidences the right people tend to come into your life okay so these four things define this state i repeat connectedness with all life with all people you tend to have a kind heart a good soul intuition you have this gut instinct on what you need to do it's not always there don't feel like you know you you it's always turned on but it's but you are more right than wrong 55 or 60 of the time and often that's enough to do really well in life you take inspired action your goals come from within not from what society tells you to do and you just feel pretty damn lucky you don't know what's going on but stuff that you intend seems to come to you easily so to get there it's about two things right like i said you got to have a vision for your future and you got to have happiness in the now so all human beings can exist with these two as leaders you could have no happiness no vision in that case you're depressed life is not going right it's a miserable state of being you should seek some help but you also have people who are happy but they have no vision i call this the current reality trap you're happy but you don't really have any plans for your life or the world now some of you might say well that's fine isn't the point of life to be happy maybe but you see you can get happy from smoking a joint with inam on the beach tonight or steve carter they they really know how to roll and but tony robbins says all of us have two great spiritual needs the need to grow and the need to contribute as souls we're here to grow we're here to contribute to other souls there's that connection bit again so if you're just happy but you don't have a vision you're never going to be fulfilled and that's really the secret you got to be happy in the now but you got to have a vision right now there are people and this is the majority of entrepreneurs around the world they have a vision but they are not happy because they've fallen into the trap of deciding that they will be happy when they attain that vision when they get that next round of investment when they hit that next salary ratio when they pull in that deal that's too because if you are in that state of limitless you find that luck is on your side that you move so much faster but you got to use happiness as a fuel and not happiness as the target your happiness must come while you're attaining your goal not at the end of that attainment yes so yes so you can map it out like that right happiness in the now vision for the future negative spiral low on vision low in happiness current reality trap high on happiness low on vision stress and anxiety which is high vision low happiness where you want to be is in that that fought box and in that box it almost feels as if you can bend reality i'm sure you guys have seen people wearing that beautiful mind valley t-shirt ben reality that's where that that idea comes from it feels we we joke about it but it feels as if you can shift the very fabric of reality to close the gap between your vision and your life right now now i i coined the word ben reality around 10 years ago when i was giving a speech on this topic on stage in calgary but what is interesting is in 2011 steve jobs passed away and walter isaacson released jobs bio and in that bio three times walter isaacson referred to what jobs could do as banned reality and i do believe that jobs was in on this because in that bio isaacson wrote about the mystical aspects of steve jobs how he believed that there were certain people who had unique abilities there's the avatars and the sages from india and he believed he was one of them i'm sure many of you guys read about steve jobs obsession with paramahansa yogananda when he before he died the only book on his ipad was autobiography of a yogi by yogananda and that book is about shifting the fabric of reality yogananda talks about how the hindus call reality maya it means illusion and that you can shift maya so steve jobs at his funeral he gave a copy of that book to everyone who attended bill gates got a copy everyone who was there got a copy and i believe at some level jobs was in on this you can bend reality now you can't talk about this now because you know movies like the secret hyped it up without really giving a clue or really approaching it from a scientific perspective but what if we could what if we could actually approach this from a scientific perspective that's what's happening now you can read this in books such as the power of a or the field or michael schmicker's um michael schmicker's book damn it i forgot the name anyway google michael schmicker if you can spell smicker but it's becoming more and more and more um commonplace to talk about this right now i only talk about this with an a-fest audience when i'm giving a corporate speech i still don't because you know regular corporations don't don't really buy into this yet but this is how we run mindvalley this is how i function in my life now i want to give you some tools to get you there okay now the first is called the six phase meditation so it's based on this idea there are six human needs that we need to level up in and if we can level up in these human needs we move ourselves to the state of limitless now the first need is a feeling of being loved and loving others so if you think about you know a high functioning computer the computer needs electricity needs to be plugged in it needs a good cpu it needs ram it needs a hard drive think of it like these these are little components of your human consciousness that you need to level up so you can get to these states the first is you must feel love for yourself marissa pierre talks about this so well and you must feel love for others for whatever reason this seems to magnify that ability number two gratitude and happiness you must be happy in the now number three peace now what we mean by peace is you have removed negative charges towards other people so at 40 years of zen you know chris's institute one of the things they do to raise your alpha right they found so so so they found that one of the quickest ways to raise your alpha is through forgiveness exercise so when you're on 40 years of zen for five days three full days you work on forgiveness you work on having your brain strapped to machines and you're applying forgiveness to remove every negative charge you have towards everyone in your life who has wronged you you know ex-business partners ex-employees school teachers parents spouses even your kids every single thing and the crazy thing is scientists are now studying forgiveness and they're finding that it actually shifts your consciousness and it shifts your body one study from a university in holland found that forgiveness increases your vertical jump think about that vertical jump after i spoke about this an nba star called me up and said hey can you get me into 40 years of zen i kid you not and um forgiveness improves your endurance but forgiveness also seems to heal the heart it seems to create less anxiety more feelings of love it makes you sleep better so it's a very powerful attribute okay so that's the first three now the next three is a vision for the future knowing where you want to be in the future self-determination meaning feeling that you have you have control over today you're here and you're not a victim of circumstance you have control over your day day to day you're not working for an abusive boss who is pushing you around or you're not an abusive relationship where someone is telling you what to do and you're not also just a helpless human being complaining about being stuck in traffic in a job you don't like most people in the world today feel as victims of the world they feel the world happens to them to have a sense of control to have self-determination you means you feel that the world happens through you and not to you yes or yes now the final ingredient is a feeling of being supported now this doesn't just mean support from family and friends it means support from a higher power it's why in many of the protocols even protocol scientists are developing you end your intention you end your forgiveness ritual with talking or seeking support from guides from god from jesus from whatever you believe in now if this was a computer game and we were characters in a computer game it should look like this you are high on all of these six qualities but actually as you go through life you deplete in these qualities and so the trick is how do you stay at top level on these qualities so what i developed over the last couple of years is a meditation protocol which is basically not a meditation protocol i'm i just i have to call it meditation for lack of better words you see meditation has become a catch-all phrase but the problem with meditation is that most meditation thought today i believe is woefully inadequate and not very powerful it's about breeding in breeding out clearing your mind focusing on your breath and yes there are benefits to that right but it's not just that we forget that when we go into these states of mind you can do more than just be peaceful you can use that mind to solve problems to practice gratitude to connect with the universe to tap into psychic potential to heal so when you talk about that you're talking about what you would call dynamic or active meditation so i developed the sixth phase as an active meditation you do not have to clear your mind you do not get bored rather your mind is working on solving problems and leveling you up in all of these six phases so again okay the six faces are feeling of being loved and loving others gratitude and happiness peace a vision for the future self-determination feeling support now in the six phase meditation you actually go through very rapid fire two minutes each a leveling up protocol for each of these six spaces we call these protocols transcendent practices a transcendent practice is any practice where you step out of the physical world you go inside yourself and you work on something creative visualization is a transcendent practice healing energy healing is a transcendent practice acupuncture reiki but also forgiveness gratitude these are all transcendent practices so all we did is i looked at the six top ones and i put this in the sixth phase now remember earlier i spoke about how you need to be happy yet have a vision for the future this is actually what the six phase is doing the first three in in that yellow border actually level up feelings of happiness see happiness doesn't just mean you're joyful that's what gratitude does it means you're free of negative charges it means you're feeling love that's why there are three different dimensions to leveling up happiness now the next is leveling up your vision for the future and that is vision for the future which is three to ten years self-determination today which is today my day is gonna rock and it's finally feeling support and this means that i know that i'm supported universe has my back and i can move throughout the day with with luck on my side okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna guide you through the six face if you guys haven't done it before but since the six phase takes is a protocol that takes some development before you leave a-fest we're actually going to for free give you a program to train you up on this how many of you here have done the six face before excellent and how many of you here do it every day when you wake up awesome so the more you do it the better and better and better it gets okay so that's one protocol that you will leave with you will leave with a six space training it's an eight day training again it's completely free you'll get to take it on mindvalley quest app i'll give you access to it in a moment now let me tell you about the second protocol right that's 40 years of zen so six space you can learn it on your own and it creates like um it creates build up even though i take 40 years of zen i still do six face every day and now i combine them so there's an advanced level six phase which i which combines what you learn from 40 years of zen with the six phase more on that in a bit now let me tell you about 40 years of zen so these are the brainwave frequencies if you are having burnout you will see that your beta wave is like super super super high beta has the waking state alpha is the state of creativity around 10 percent of the people function really well in waking alpha they tend to be artists they tend to be creators they tend to be people who often feel lucky waking tata is where is the state that is often associated with sleep so i i've seen dave asprey train on waking theta he starts drifting off into sleep but ideas come to you now delta is the most interesting one about one percent of the population when we test them at 40 years of zen they have waking delta what we what they have found with waking delta is that these people have a high ability to create coincidences or create luck they tend to be crazy uh influential they tend to be billionaires um one person i did 40 years of zen with she has waking delta like they would see that in her brain waves so most of us go into delta when we're asleep she could do it when she was awake and what they found at 40 years of zen is if you can do it when you're awake it's high correlation with luck you tend to be pretty successful this lady insanely successful she got like two million bucks as an advance for her next book right amazingly successful but she would find that her thoughts would become real and as soon as the the doctors told her that at 40 years of zen she's like oh my god oh my god oh god now i understand and i'm like what happened what do you understand she says okay so i was dating this guy and then he did something really nasty and he cheated on me and i was so upset and i broke up with him and i said damn it i hope he breaks his penis and the next day he fell off a ladder and broke his penis so um men don't with women who have high waking delta they can so so i did 40 years of zen right um with jeffrey jeffrey perlman uh those are some some other students some of them are uh a festers or from mindvalley u and that's doctor drew in the center now there are a couple of different exercises you do there so one of the things is they use these 3d helmets there are very few of these in the world but they are 3d helmets you plug them on your brain and you look at the screen and you basically see the deficiencies in your brain so they map your brain dr drew maps the brain for about uh he works with chris for about 20 minutes so that's my brain i have three brain issues asperger's i sometimes accidentally flip words so i'm like i'll be talking to someone from my team and i'll call them by another person's name but i don't realize that they realize that and people know that happens my brain sometimes split words um and i have a third one which um i i forgot right now anyway it's good when you forget when you forget your problems so um they map your brain and then um your brain actually is listening to sound and just like your brain your your brain's awareness extends to every element of your body your fingers and so on your brain extends its awareness to that sound and that sound gives your brain feedback and you can see over time my what i'm trying to do over here is improve my ability to recognize non-verbal communication it's to basically fight asperger's right so you can see over the sessions my score's going up and then it kind of stabilizes at between 63 and 65 but below that it was 55 very rapidly those parts of the brain start lighting up so it's a really really cool system um now the next thing that happens is that you go for acupuncture so again we are finding that consciousness is not just in the brain it's through our entire body the the ancient chinese figured this out when they mapped meridian lines so you go for acupuncture and they stick needles in you um so you go and map your brain and they stick needles in your head then just so the rest of your body doesn't feel left out you go and stick needles in the rest of your body now the final thing and this is the biggest one you sit in the chamber there's kind of like a red light over there you wear a helmet like that and basically what's going on is that this is where they train you to access these states if you have low alpha you get trained to improve your alpha and after you've done that a couple of um sessions you can get trained to improve your data you can get trained um and for and for a few special guests you can get trained to work on your delta but before you get trained to work on your delta you got to do a heck of a lot of forgiveness because here's what they found with delta training you can walk the world for good or for bad and and this is something i never thought i thought you know if you're spiritually developed you can only do good turns out no you can walk the world for good or for bad so they want to make sure that all anger has been removed because one of the pioneers of this training dr jim harp he runs another institute where you which is similar to 40 years of zen um it's called biocybernaut it's in victoria now i've done both i've done both and i honestly believe 40 years of zen is significantly better but jim hart found that he told me um well you could train people to be luke skywalker or you could train people to be darth vader and i've trained a few darth vaders and i never want to do it again so forgiveness is so so so important all anger all hate must disappear so again that's a that's a map of my brain i so i have gifts in certain areas deficiencies in certain areas when i'm working my beta can go through the roof and then i feel um stress but i'm training myself now to to detect it and then slow it down so when my beta is going up i actually feel this pain in my heart area right here and as soon as i feel it now i've triggered that in my body as soon as i feel it i know my brain is going into less efficient uh functioning and so i do protocols to lower that pain now theta i fall asleep but delta i really delta like fires me up so i have really off the charts waking delta and so when i learned that at 40 years of zen i started developing protocols where i could use that waking delta to create coincidences so now the way i meditate the way i work is very different everything i do i work i go into delta and i work on the energy of it now when you're working in delta you cannot do creative visualization creative visualization slows down delta brings up alpha so when you're working in delta you go straight into emotions and feelings and energy you feel energy you tap into energy you play with energy for example before giving a speech i'll spend 20 seconds going into delta and feeling the energy of the speech and the room and i'll see little black spots where the energy is off and then i i patch it up with light and that's how i i function in my life right now everything i create starts by tapping into these access states working with the energy so i want to show you the uh just a little video i did of the two instructors waving to you guys that sounds so cheesy okay just just look at the camera just smile so they're really friendly people they're not like mad scientists that's dr drew brilliant guy um so that's 40 years of zen now how do you access these states because we want to make sure those of you who want to stop exploring these states have a next step so the first step is the six phase we have we're giving you the training completely free you do not have to pay a dime now you can get it from mindvalley's quest app so the training is basically i will guide you through the six phases one phase a day for for seven days sorry for six days day one you learn the first phase which is compassion day two we stack on the second phase gratitude day three we stack on the third phase which is um forgiveness and you learn the protocols it's 20 minutes a day and then a 10 minute meditation it's on the quest app so you can download quests right now on android or ipad or iphone even on apple tv we are on all the platforms you can even do it on on on the web download the quest app and um basically just click and roll you'll find that there's no buy button or anything and then start it when you're ready and do day one to day six and on day seven basically what happens on day seven is we put all the six phases today uh together and we guide you through it so here's just a quick one minute video of the quest app so you know what what this tool is about and how cool this is this is probably the number one learning platform in the world right now in terms of really high quality education and high engagement rates uh check it out i'm ready to play now put me in the game now i came here to prove it i'm ready to do it i can't be afraid now put me on the stage now i'm ready to rage now i feel like an animal stuck in a cage and i'm ready to break out my time my time none of you people can tell me to stop this time like the last time you better yeah cool so um so you can take the six face on quest and the reason we give it freeze because we know once you get on this app you're gonna love it and then maybe you'll take some of the other programs
