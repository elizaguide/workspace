Sub: 7 sacred states to becoming unfuckwithable 
Pre: You don’t need better goals. You need a better state.

The 7 Sacred States
What I've learned about becoming truly unfuckwithable and why your goals will only match your frequency

By Vishen Lakhiani


I woke up one morning a few years ago and something was off.

On paper, everything looked great. Mindvalley was growing. The books were selling. I had a beautiful family, an incredible team, a life most people would envy.

But inside? I felt hollow. Reactive. Constantly chasing the next goal, the next milestone, the next validation.
I had spent years building something extraordinary — and I couldn't even enjoy it.
That's when I started asking a different question.
Not "How do I achieve more?" but "What state am I operating from?"
That question changed everything.
"Your goals will only match your frequency."This single insight rewired how I approach everything: business, relationships, and life itself. 


When you set goals from anxiety, you create more things to be anxious about. 
When you make decisions from confusion, you create more confusion. 
When you build from scarcity, you attract scarcity.
But when you shift the state you're operating from? Everything changes.
I've now shared this framework in seminar rooms in London, at island retreats in Mykonos, with entrepreneurs, with artists, with people who run billion-dollar companies and people just starting out.
The response is always the same:
"It makes me feel different. It makes me look at my life through a different lens. For the longest time, I've been chasing goals. Now I finally understand the truth."

The Truth Nobody Talks About

Here it is: Most people try to change their external circumstances while operating from a broken internal state.

They set goals from anxiety and create more things to be anxious about.
They make decisions from confusion and create more confusion.
They build relationships from scarcity and attract scarcity.
Think about it. When you sit down to plan your new year, what state are you usually in?
Exhausted. Scattered. Anxious about whether things will work out. Still carrying wounds from past failures.
And from that place you try to design your dream life?
Here’s the thing: 

You don't need better goals. You need a better state. 
When you upgrade your internal operating system, your goals, decisions, and actions automatically upgrade with it. 
This is the leverage point most people miss entirely.



The ancient Greeks had a word for this ideal state: Ataraxia, a serene calmness that cannot be disturbed by external events.

I call it being unfuckwithable.
And after 22 years of studying human transformation, I've identified exactly seven internal states that create it.
The 7 Sacred States

Each one is trainable. Each one compounds the others. Together, they create a way of being that transforms not just what you achieve but who you become.
State #1 Knowingness

Understanding who you are at the deepest level.
The universe reflects who you ARE, not what you want. When you stand in your worth with unshakeable certainty, opportunities align, because you're no longer sending mixed signals to the world.

"The world cannot give you what you're not willing to claim."
State #2 Faith 

Trusting before you have proof.
What's meant for you cannot miss you. What misses you was never yours. When you embody faith, you stop white-knuckling life, and paradoxically, that's when things start flowing.
"Doubt is just faith pointed in the wrong direction."
State #3 Love

Generating love within and beaming it outward.
HeartMath research shows this literally changes your biology, and the biology of people around you. When you operate from love, doors open that force could never unlock.
"Love is not something you find. It's something you become."
State #4 Stillness
Becoming the eye of the storm.
Your best ideas, clearest decisions, and deepest intuition all come from the quiet. The warrior's secret weapon isn't aggression; it's the ability to remain still when everyone else is panicking.
"The answers you seek are already within you. They're just waiting for you to get quiet enough to hear them."
State #5 Non-Attachment

I want it. Working for it. But not needing it.
Steve Jobs got fired from Apple. He shrugged, started Pixar, and eventually returned to build the most valuable company on Earth. When rejection loses its sting, you become antifragile.
"Hold your dreams like water, tightly enough to carry them, loosely enough to let them flow."
State #6 Devotion

Discipline elevated to a sacred practice.
When your work becomes worship and your commitment becomes unbreakable, you tap into a reservoir of energy that willpower alone can never access. This is the state that creates legacies.
"Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most."
State #7 Receiving

Opening your cup and letting it fill.
Most people unconsciously block what life wants to give them. Receiving is the active practice of allowing, and it's often the missing piece for people who work hard but never get what they deserve.
"You cannot pour from an empty cup, and you cannot fill a cup you won't hold out."
Here's what's remarkable: 

Each state amplifies the others. 

Knowingness makes Faith easier. 
Faith makes Non-Attachment natural. 
Non-Attachment opens up Receiving. 

Together, they compound into something extraordinary — a state of being that is genuinely unfuckwithable.

This is the core framework from my upcoming book, The Art of Becoming Unfuckwithable.

But the book won't be out until 2027. And I don't want you to wait that long.


The Art Of Becoming Unfuckwithable By Vishen Lakhiani

Coming 2027



My next book introduces the complete 7 Sacred States methodology. 

But you don't have to wait.

I'm going to LIVE for free to teach you the entire framework before the new year.

Why Now? 

We're about to enter a new year. And right now, millions of people are preparing to set goals, make resolutions, and try to change their lives.

Most of them will fail.

Not because they lack willpower. Because they're trying to create change from the wrong state.

What if you could enter 2025 differently?

What if, instead of setting goals from exhaustion and anxiety, you set them from Knowingness, Faith, and Stillness?

What if you approached your biggest challenges with Non-Attachment and Devotion?

What if you were finally open to Receiving everything life wants to give you?


The 7 Sacred States Challenge



Starting Tomorrow, Dec 18 till Dec 24, I'm running a free 7-day challenge where I'll guide you through each of these states, one per day.
This isn't a surface-level overview. Each day, you'll get:
- The philosophy:  the deeper meaning behind each state and why it matters.
- 
- The science:  what modern research tells us about how these states work.
- 
- The stories:  tales from history, culture, and my encounters with prominent people who embody these states, to make each lesson land.
- 
- A daily ritual:  a 10-15 minute practice you can use immediately.
- 
- Live Q&A: where I'll answer your questions directly
By December 24th, you'll have a complete toolkit for becoming unfuckwithable. And you'll enter 2025 from a state you may never have experienced before.
And I'm offering it completely free.
[Join the 7 Sacred States Challenge]

December 18-24, 2024 • Completely Free
Reset your state before you set your goals.
Here's my promise to you:
If you show up for all seven days and do the practices, you will not be the same person on December 24th that you were on December 18th.
The way you think will shift. The way you feel will shift. The way you approach your goals, your relationships, your challenges — all of it will shift.
Because you'll finally be operating from the state that makes everything else possible.
Most people will spend New Year's Eve making promises to a version of themselves that doesn't exist yet.

You? You'll already be that person.

That's the difference between hoping for change and embodying it

Don't enter 2026 the way you entered 2024.

Enter it unfuckwithable.

I'll see you tomorrow on day 1 of the challenge (Dec 18) 

Vishen
P.S: Everyone who shows up for the challenge gets my "Knowingness Meditation" audio, a guided practice to anchor your identity and worth. It's something I've never released publicly before. Claim your spot at the challenge here 
P.P.S. I’d love to hear from you. Which of the seven states do you feel you’re missing most right now? Share your thoughts in the comments below, I read them all.
