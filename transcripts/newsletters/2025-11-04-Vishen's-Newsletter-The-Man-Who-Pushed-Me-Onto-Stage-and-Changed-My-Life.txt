Sub: The Man Who Pushed Me Onto Stage (and Changed My Life)

Pre: This story starts with a man named Bob Proctor.

The Man Who Pushed Me Onto Stage (and Changed My Life)
In Loving Memory of Bob Proctor
There are a few people you meet in life who change your trajectory forever.
For me, one of those people was Bob Proctor.
If you’ve ever listened to The Secret or stumbled upon an old YouTube video of a white-haired gentleman talking about “paradigms” and the power of the subconscious mind — that’s Bob. 
He was one of the world’s most beloved teachers on prosperity consciousness. 
He spent over 60 years helping millions of people reprogram their thinking to unlock abundance, confidence, and self-worth.
But for me, Bob wasn’t just a teacher.
He was my first mentor.
The day Bob Proctor threw me to the wolves 🫣
Back in 2005, Bob came to Malaysia to give a seminar.
I was just a young entrepreneur — no fame, no followers, no stage experience.
Right before his talk, he turned to me and said,
“Vishen, I want you to introduce me.”
I froze.
I’d never spoken to an audience before.
But Bob just smiled that mischievous smile of his — the kind that said, “You’ll thank me later.”
So I walked on stage, palms sweating, voice shaking, heart trying to escape my chest…
And I absolutely butchered that introduction.
But that’s how Bob operated.
He had this uncanny way of pushing you into discomfort — not to watch you squirm, but because he knew that’s where your next level lived.
And I often wonder…
Where would I be today if Bob hadn’t given me that first uncomfortable push?
The day Bob walked into the Mindvalley office 💎
Fast forward to 2014. Bob visited the Mindvalley office in Kuala Lumpur.
He gave an unforgettable talk, filled with that trademark blend of wisdom and fire.
And then, just before he left, he said something I’ll never forget:
“I’d like to record a meditation for you.”

Bob Recording the Abundance Meditation  in our Office in 2014. 
So we found the quietest corner we could — a simple desk, my old iPhone 5 — and hit record.
That’s how The Abundance Meditation was born.
The audio wasn’t perfect (thank you, 2014 microphone quality 😅).
But what poured through Bob’s voice was pure magic.
We uploaded it to YouTube and later added it to the Mindvalley app.
Over the years, 4.2 million people listened to it. 
It became one of the most loved meditations in our library.

So, What is Abundance Meditation About ? 

Let’s unpack the Abundance Meditation and how it will help you, 
It’s not just about attracting a bigger bank balance. 
It’s about rewiring your mind to recognize the abundance that’s already here. 
Think of it as turning up the volume on the good stuff.
Bob Proctor’s work is all about mindset, and this meditation is a concentrated dose of that. 

It’s designed to help you:
1. Smash limiting beliefs: Those sneaky thoughts that tell you “not enough” or “not possible”? This meditation helps dismantle them.
2. 
3. Visualize abundance: You’ll be guided to create a vivid picture of your abundant life. This isn’t just daydreaming, it’s programming your subconscious.
4. Feel the feeling: The key isn’t just seeing it, but feeling the gratitude and joy of already having it. That’s what magnetizes it to you.
This meditation isn’t a magic wand, but it’s a powerful tool for shifting your perspective and opening yourself up to receive. 

Just like you’re expanding your consciousness and building that solid foundation to manifest your intentions into reality. 
The voice our community couldn’t let go of
Recently, our team decided to clean up the recording.
We used AI to remove the background fuzz and smooth the sound.
We thought we were doing a good thing.
But something surprising happened.
Our inbox filled with messages from the community:
“Please bring back the original version.”
 “We love hearing Bob’s real voice.”
And that’s when I realized something profound.
Perfection doesn’t always make things better.

Sometimes, it’s the imperfections that carry the soul.
A story that proves the power of practice
One of my favorite stories came from DJ Bliss, one of the Middle East’s top musicians.
During an interview, he told me he listened to Bob’s Abundance Meditation 100 days in a row.
What happened next was wild —
His career exploded.
He landed a spot on the world’s #1 reality show, Dubai Bling.
And he said, “That meditation changed my life.”
That’s the kind of magic Bob left behind.

Final thought 
Every time I hear Bob’s voice say,
“You were born rich,”
 I remember that day in 2005 when he shoved me onto that stage.
I had no idea then that he wasn’t just introducing me to an audience.
He was introducing me to my destiny.
