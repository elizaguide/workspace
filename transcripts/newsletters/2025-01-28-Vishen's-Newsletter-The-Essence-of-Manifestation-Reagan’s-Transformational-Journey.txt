	The C.R.Y.S.T.A.L Formula: 7 Keys to Manifesting Your Best Life

I just got back from an incredible experience in Dubai: Masters of Manifesting. This event wasn’t just about the power of manifesting—it was about taking what feels intangible and giving it form, structure, and flow.
Manifesting is one of the most sought-after topics at Mindvalley, and it’s something I’ve personally explored for decades. To me, manifesting is the art of turning the dreams in your mind into reality—faster, more effectively, and with greater joy and ease.
At this event, we brought together amazing speakers like Reagan Hillyer (The Art of Manifesting), Jeffrey Allen (Duality and Unlocking Transcendence), John Lee (Seven Figure Creator), and yes, me.

As I sat there taking notes from these incredible minds, a powerful realization struck me: manifesting doesn’t have to feel mysterious or complex. There’s a simple, actionable framework anyone can follow.
I call it the CRYSTAL formula—seven key steps that make your manifesting journey crystal clear. Whether you’re manifesting a dream job, a soulmate, financial freedom, or just a better version of yourself, this formula can help you bring it to life.
Let’s dive in.
C: Clarity
“Vague desires produce vague results.”
Let’s start with the foundation. Clarity is the most important step in manifesting—and also the most overlooked.
If your vision is fuzzy, your results will be, too. You can’t just say, “I want more money” or “I want a better job.” You need to get specific. What’s the exact salary you want? What kind of company do you want to work for? What’s the daily experience you want to create for yourself?
Here’s how to get crystal clear:
1. Write it down. Goals written down are 42% more likely to be achieved.
2. Visualize it. Close your eyes and create a vivid mental picture. What does your ideal life look like?
3. Use tools. Programs like Mindvalley’s Lifebook guide you to map out your entire life vision in extraordinary detail, creating a personal blueprint for your future.
The clearer your vision, the easier it is to focus your energy. Clarity creates alignment, and alignment creates momentum.

R: Resilience
“The road to success isn’t linear—it’s a rollercoaster.”
Let’s be honest: manifesting your dreams isn’t always smooth sailing. You will face setbacks, challenges, and moments of doubt. The key is how you respond when things don’t go as planned.
Michael Beckwith, one of my mentors, talks about “Kensho moments”—growth that comes through challenges. These are the times when life throws you into the fire, testing your strength and commitment.
Resilience is about developing the grit to move forward, no matter what. But it’s also about self-compassion. Treat yourself with kindness. Love yourself through the tough moments.
Here’s how to cultivate resilience:
1. Reframe setbacks. Ask yourself, “What lesson is this trying to teach me?”
2. Anchor yourself in your vision. Remind yourself of your “why.”
3. Celebrate progress. Every small step forward is a victory worth celebrating.
Manifesting is a journey, not a straight line. Stay resilient, and you’ll turn obstacles into stepping stones.

Y: Your Inner Voice
“Listen to your heart and intuition. Somehow, they already know who you are meant to become.” – Steve Jobs
Too often, we set goals based on what others expect of us—parents, society, culture. But true manifesting starts when you connect with your inner voice.
Intuition is like a compass, pointing you toward what’s aligned with your soul. But to hear it, you need to quiet the external noise: the societal expectations, the cultural pressures, and the opinions of others.
Here’s how to strengthen your intuition:
- Meditate. Silence the chatter in your mind.
- Journal. Writing helps you uncover your inner truth.
- Ask yourself. When faced with a decision, pause and ask, “Does this feel expansive or restrictive?”
When you trust your inner voice, you align with your deepest truths—and that’s where the real magic happens.

S: Speed of Action
“Don’t wait for the perfect moment. Start now.”
Manifesting isn’t just about thinking—it’s about doing. The moment you take action, you tell the universe: “I’m serious about this.”
Napoleon Hill, in Think and Grow Rich, emphasizes the power of small, consistent steps. Every action, no matter how small, builds momentum.
Let’s say you’re starting a business. Here’s how to break it down:
1. Research domain names.
2. Register your business.
3. Sketch out your first product idea.
4. Each step creates clarity for the next. Action isn’t just about progress—it’s about signaling your intention to the universe.

T: Trust
“What you believe about the world tends to become true.” 
Trust is the cornerstone of manifesting. It’s about belief and expectancy. José Silva, the legendary founder of the Silva Method, taught that manifesting isn’t just about desire. It’s about three things:
1. Desire. Get clear on what you want.
2. Belief. Cultivate unshakable faith that it’s possible.
3. Expectancy. Act as if it’s already happening.
The law of resonance says that the universe reflects who you are, not what you want. When you believe and expect your vision to come true, you align yourself with the frequency of your desires.
Visualization is one of the most powerful tools here. José Silva emphasized the importance of imagining your goals so vividly that your brain starts treating them as real. We call this approach Creative Visualization. Programs like Be Extraordinary and Creative Visualization teach this in depth, helping you turn belief into reality.

A: Alignment
“When your energy, mind, and body align, magic happens.”
Manifesting isn’t just about action—it’s about energy. Alignment means syncing your physical, emotional, and spiritual states with your desires.
Practices like gratitude, forgiveness, and compassion aren’t just feel-good exercises—they’re scientifically proven to elevate your vibration. For example, studies show that forgiveness can improve physical performance and even increase endurance.
Here’s how to get aligned:
- Practice forgiveness to release emotional blocks.
- Use gratitude to elevate your energy.
- Meditate to center your mind and body.
Jeffrey Allen’s program Duality is perfect for this, teaching you how to align your energy with your goals. And the 6 Phase Meditation is a daily practice that shifts you into a state of flow, amplifying your ability to manifest.

L: Love Your Journey
“Gratitude turns your journey into a masterpiece.”
This step is about embracing the process. Manifesting isn’t just about achieving—it’s about experiencing joy along the way.
Tim Storey calls this “magical living.” and goes deep into it in his Quest on Mindvalley. It’s about appreciating the small, beautiful moments in life. 
Recently, I spoke with Grammy-winning artist Eve, who shared her personal gratitude practice: “I simply express gratitude for everything—the sun, the trees, the flowers. It keeps me grounded and joyful.”
When you focus on gratitude, you amplify the joy and abundance in your life, which, in turn, attracts more of it.
		
Final Thoughts
The CRYSTAL formula is more than just a checklist—it’s a lifestyle. Each step builds on the others, creating a powerful framework to manifest your dreams.
Now, let me share something truly exciting.
If you’ve been scrolling through social media recently, you’ve probably seen the jaw-dropping photos from our Mindvalley Gala at the iconic Dubai Expo. It was a night where transformation met luxury—a celebration of the world’s greatest teachers, innovators, and thought leaders.
The energy in that room was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Imagine standing under the stunning Dubai skyline, surrounded by people like Steven Kotler, Jay Shetty, Regan Hillyer, and Paul McKenna. Each story, each standing ovation, each moment of connection—it was a collective manifestation of what’s possible when we dream big and act boldly.
And we thought, why should this energy be limited to one night?
