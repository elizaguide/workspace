My honest response to “How do I really go big?”


Hey [First Name], 
Last week in Amsterdam, I stood in front of 500+ coaches at the Supercoach Summit.
 Some of the most brilliant, heart-driven people on the planet were in that room.
And someone asked me a question that made the whole room lean in:
“Vishen… how do I really go big?”
I shared this message live in Amsterdam:

If you prefer to read my full answer, here’s the exact transcript from the video for you - below: 
Don't see yourself as just a coach. See yourself as a movement builder. 
What movement are you going to build? 
Now, you don't have to do this, but if you want to go big, you've got to figure out your movement. 
My movement is not Mindvalley. My movement is unity. Mindvalley is simply the enabler of unity. 
Unity consciousness means expanding a human being's understanding of life so they want to do good in the world.
 And to do good in the world, you need to improve your personal power. 
You need to get really good at, say, building a business or developing skills or becoming a teacher, or becoming a healer. 
But then, you've got to expand that to think about people outside your country, outside your religion, outside your skin color, and see yourself as a citizen of planet Earth and help us heal this planet and heal humanity.
I'm fascinated by unity because I grew up on Star Trek. I'm fascinated by unity because I was once on the Muslim watch list. 
And the reason I left America is because I had to report to the police every four weeks for a background check because of the color of my skin and the identity on my passport.
 That's why unity matters. 
So I wasn't trying to build a company. I was trying to build a movement around unity. 
It's why Mindvalley employees come from 60 countries. 
It's why our company is global. It's why our authors come from all across the world. It's why I can speak for Gaza. But this week, sign and promote an Israeli Author.
It's because unity is my highest value.
 I'm building a movement for unity. 
I believe the universe is gracious. 
And if we're doing something in alignment with the wish of a higher power or the universe, what will happen is we will be blessed. 
Jose Silva said, whatever you want to visualize, see two or more people benefiting. 
He found that after training millions of people, the more people who benefit from your dream, the more likely your dream is to manifest.
 So maybe you're trying to serve one person. 
Maybe you're happy to serve five high-paying clients. 
That's great. You're a good coach. 
You want to break the ceiling? Go from coach to movement builder. 
What is that that your soul wants you to give to the world as a movement?
Is it like that lady who started the kindness meetups and talks? 
Is it me who created this company to achieve unity? 
Is it something else? Is it women's rights? Is it conscious parenting? Is it eating healthy? 
Is it changing the narrative on food and medicine? 
It doesn't matter what it is. 
Use your coaching as I did as a stepping stone for that ideal. Build a movement. 
If you shift your identity from coach to movement builder, that is how you end up accidentally with an empire, and you make the world better.


If this sparked something in you, let me know in the comments and tell me what movement you want to build?
To your movement,

 Vishen
