Sub: Before You Take Ozempic, Read This
Pre: The $12,000 Mistake and Why You Should Think Twice About GLP-1 Drugs
WildFit vs. Ozempic: The Truth Big Pharma Won’t Tell You
Mindvalley family,
Let’s talk about something that could change your life.
Right now, millions of people are turning to GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro to lose weight. The promise? A simple injection that curbs your appetite, melts away fat, and makes cravings disappear. Sounds amazing, right?
I thought so too. Until I interviewed this man last night. 
The interview is live on Youtube and it’s 25 mins and truly worth a watch. 


Link to the Youtube Video here.
Now for your convenience I wanted to share the key ideas from this interview with you in today’s newsletter. The person I’m speaking to is Eric Edmeades. The brilliant transformational architect who created Wildfit. Eric’s process of teaching people how to lose weight has been so effective he’s been awarded a medal by the Canadian Senate and invited to speak at the Parliament in the UK. 

Our interview last night happened randomly. We were filming something totally different and Eric said “Vishen, if you have time, I really want to share some important information on Ozempic.”
I’m glad I said yes. I’m sharing the interview as a video on Youtube (25 mins) (link here) and in summarized form in this email. 
Now Eric created Wildfit. So Wildfit is a competitor to Ozempic. I just want to be clear about this upfront. But what I like about Wildfit is that it creates long term results and is natural and safe. And it’s also now included in Mindvalley Membership so if you’re a member you don’t have to pay anything extra. 
And on the other hand with Ozempic (a type of GLP-1 medicationmeditation) …
GLP-1 drugs cost a staggering $11,000–$12,000 a year in the U.S.
They come with serious side effects—muscle loss, nausea, fatigue, and even long-term risks like thyroid cancer.
And worst of all? They’re designed to be a lifetime prescription. Once you start, stopping becomes nearly impossible.

I've placed the full 25-minute interview on YouTube, where Eric and I break down:

 ✅ How GLP-1 drugs trick your body into losing weight
 ✅ The shocking long-term risks (that nobody talks about)
 ✅ Why WildFit can naturally trigger the same response—without the need for medication
Or if you prefer reading, here’s the summarized transcript of our conversation:
Interview: Vishen Lakhiani & Eric Edmeades on WildFit vs. GLP-1 Medications
Interview: Vishen Lakhiani & Eric Edmeades on WildFit vs. GLP-1 Medications
Vishen Lakhiani: Mindvalley members and aspiring members, today’s conversation is a game-changer. We’re in a world where people are jumping onto medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro to manage their weight. But at Mindvalley, we believe there’s a better way. That’s why I’m speaking with Eric Edmeades, founder of WildFit, a program that’s transformed over 150,000 lives over the past nine years.
1. Vishen: Eric, I want to dive right into it. These GLP-1 drugs are everywhere, but you say they’re unnecessary. Why?
Eric Edmeades: Simply put, we can trick the body into thinking it’s already taking one of these medications—without the actual drug. GLP-1 medications work by making you feel full, but they’re essentially tricking your body into thinking it’s nourished. The good news? We can achieve the same biochemical response naturally with the right nutrition and metabolic approach.
2. Vishen: That’s fascinating. But let’s take a step back—what exactly is a GLP-1?
Eric: GLP-1 stands for glucagon-like peptide-1. It’s a natural peptide your body produces when you eat certain foods, signaling that you’re full. These drugs are synthetic versions of that peptide. It’s like tanning in the sun versus using a tanning bed—one is natural and beneficial, while the other is an artificial substitute with potential side effects.
3. Vishen: So let’s talk about those downsides. A lot of people are saying GLP-1 is working for them, but they’re also paying somewhere around $11,000 a year. That’s the average price in the U.S., right? But then there are all of these side effects, and, like many pharmaceuticals, these drugs are designed to be taken for life. What are some of the side effects here?
Eric: First, they don’t just reduce fat—they reduce overall body mass, including muscle and bone density. That’s a major issue because muscle mass is directly linked to longevity and healthspan.
Then there are the immediate side effects: nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and a total loss of interest in food. That last one may sound like a dream for someone struggling with cravings, but it’s actually a nightmare. GLP-1 drugs suppress nutritional hunger but do nothing for emotional hunger. People still reach for comfort foods, but now they’re eating even less of the nutrient-dense foods their body actually needs.
4. Vishen: That’s scary. But are there psychological side effects as well? You speak so much about how food is psychology in WildFit.
Eric: Absolutely. These drugs weaken your willpower. When you artificially suppress your cravings, you don’t build the executive function necessary to manage food choices. And here’s the kicker: The part of the brain that controls willpower for food also controls willpower for everything else—exercise, productivity, relationships. So as willpower weakens, so does your ability to make strong decisions in other areas of life.
5. Vishen: That’s scary. And what about long-term side effects?
Eric: It’s funny—there is a lot of focus on short-term side effects because people tend to think short-term. But there are now studies suggesting increased risks of thyroid cancer, pancreatic issues, and severe muscle loss. Muscle mass is directly correlated with healthspan and longevity—so if you’re losing muscle, you’re essentially accelerating aging. Anything that threatens your muscle mass is something to think twice about.
6. Vishen: And a lot of people who take these drugs seem to get stuck. They have to keep taking them, it’s expensive, and then they have long-term side effects. Why do people seem unable to stop taking them?
Eric: Think about it this way—when you take a drug that artificially suppresses your appetite, you don’t have to exercise any willpower. Your executive function gets weaker. When people stop the drug, their appetite seems to come back stronger. But it’s not that the cravings have intensified—their ability to resist has weakened.
7. Vishen: So if we decide not to go down the GLP-1 path, how do we activate the same quality in our body naturally?
Eric: GLP-1 is a synthetic mimic of a peptide we already make when we eat certain foods. If we prioritize those foods, our body produces the same response—without the need for an injection. Nutrient-dense foods, healthy fats, and proteins trigger this naturally. On the other hand, processed foods and sugar do the opposite and make you hungrier.
8. Vishen: You also mentioned the concept of timing your meals and breaking free from processed food. How are these related?
Eric: Most of the food in grocery stores today is designed for profitability, not nutrition. It’s nutritionally empty and full of addictive substances that stimulate appetite. But there’s also a timing issue—ancestral food patterns show that our bodies aren’t designed to eat first thing in the morning or snack late at night. If we align our eating patterns with how our metabolism evolved, we can achieve better health and natural appetite regulation.
9. Vishen: So, final question for you, Eric. What would you say to someone who’s thinking about taking GLP-1 right now?
Eric: If you haven’t started yet, I’d strongly recommend going through WildFit first. By week six or seven, you’ll have triggered the same response in your body naturally, and you won’t need the drug. If you’re already on it, speak to your doctor about slowly weaning off while implementing WildFit principles. We’ll help you through that process so you can regain control without being dependent on the medication.
10. Vishen: That makes absolute sense. Before committing to something with such radical side effects, high costs, and long-term risks, people should try something like WildFit first.
So the kickoff class for WildFit is happening shortly. All you have to do is sign up using your Mindvalley membership. And again, it’s a 90-day program. Commit to doing it now. WildFit won’t disrupt your schedule—it will actually enhance your mental clarity, focus, and sleep. The results start happening before the end of the first month.
Eric, this has been eye-opening. Thank you for comparing Ozempic and GLP-1s with WildFit—I’ve learned so much from this conversation.
So as you can see GLP-1 medications are not as innocent as they are made out to be. 
But what if I told you there’s a natural, more effective way to achieve the same results—without the injections, the side effects, or the cost?
This is why we’re bringing WildFit to every Mindvalley member for free.
Why WildFit is Now Part of Your Mindvalley Membership
When we first launched WildFit, it was a game-changer. It was one of the most powerful nutrition programs ever created.
People were paying $1,500 to go through it, and the results were nothing short of stunning. Later, we brought the price down to $800, when we reached 150,000 Wildfit graduates making it more accessible.
Now, we’re taking things one step further.
WildFit is now INCLUDED in Mindvalley Membership.
That means instead of paying $800—or spending over $11,000 a year on GLP-1 drugs—you can start right now, for free as part of your membership.
If you’re not a Mindvalley member yet, the cost of joining is a fraction of what one month of GLP-1 drugs would cost. And I promise you—WildFit is just as, if not more, effective.
That’s why I produced this interview with WildFit founder Eric Edmeades—to help you see the truth about GLP-1 drugs before making a life-altering decision.
