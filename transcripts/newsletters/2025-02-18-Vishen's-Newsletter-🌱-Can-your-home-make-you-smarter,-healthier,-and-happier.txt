✅ Can Your Home Make You Smarter, Healthier, and Happier?
✅ The Hidden Ways Your Home Affects Your Energy (And How to Fix It)
✅ Why Your Home Might Be Secretly Draining Your Energy—And How to Fix It

Hi (Name),
What if your home could make you healthier? What if it could help you think better, age slower, and feel more alive—just by existing?
Most people don’t realize just how much their living space affects them. The air they breathe, the water they drink, the way their home is arranged—it’s all either supporting their energy or quietly draining it.
I used to think a home was just a home. A place to sleep, eat, and store way too many Amazon impulse buys. But then I stepped inside EYWA, and everything I thought I knew about living spaces changed.
Nestled in the heart of Dubai, EYWA is not just another luxury residence—it’s a revolution in conscious living. Part home, part sacred space, part longevity center, it’s designed to activate your highest potential. It’s a new building concept that recently won an Award at the London Property Awards for being the BEST new building development in the world.

And once you see this….you can never again see buildings in the same way. 




EYWA isn’t just a luxury residence.
It's a living, breathing ecosystem—designed to heal the human body and soul.
And visiting the EYWA showroom in Dubai made me realize just how important it is to design our own living spaces to optimize our energy, creativity, and longevity. 
In this email, I want to share what I’ve learned—not just from EYWA’s visionary creator, Alex Zagrebelny, but also from Mindvalley author Marie Diamond, whose work is about bringing ancient wisdom on energy and space into the modern world.

Eywa: The True Luxury of Tomorrow
Buildings That Support Well-Being, Longevity, and Spiritual Growth
Imagine stepping into a space that doesn’t just house you—but heals you.
A place where the air feels alive, the water nourishes you at a cellular level, and the very walls seem to whisper ancient wisdom.
This isn’t a futuristic fantasy.
It’s real. It’s EYWA.
And here’s what makes it even more extraordinary—it’s modeled after the Banyan Tree, known as the Tree of Life. Its intertwining structure symbolizes connection, wisdom, and renewal, creating a space that doesn’t just look beautiful—it actively nurtures your energy.

We’ve seen luxury real estate go through its fair share of trends. From branded residences tied to fashion designers to homes that feel more like art galleries.
But let’s be real—what’s the point of a high-end address if it doesn’t make you feel better, live longer, and elevate your consciousness?
The Vision Behind Eywa
Eywa isn’t just an architectural marvel—it’s a philosophy in action.
Visionary developer Alex Zagrebelny didn’t just set out to build another high-end residence. He wanted to create a living, breathing ecosystem—one that fuses ancient Vedic wisdom with cutting-edge modern science.
As Alex told me, his inspiration came from a deeply personal place:
"I looked at my wife and children and realized—I don’t want this world for them. Not like this. I wanted to create something better. A way of living that restores harmony between humanity and nature. A home that doesn’t just shelter you but elevates you."
And so, Eywa was born.
My First Encounter with EYWA
The first time I walked into the EYWA showroom, I knew this was different.
You don’t just see it. You feel it.
The energy is palpable—like stepping into a sacred temple where every element—air, water, materials—is tuned to nourish your mind, body, and spirit.
I felt lighter. Sharper. More at ease.
It was as if my body recognized, Yes, this is how a home is supposed to feel.
And at that moment, I knew—I had to be part of this.
And not just for myself.
Mindvalley is building a Mindvalley House inside Eywa.
This will be a shared sanctuary for authors, thought leaders, and teachers visiting Dubai—a space designed for peak creativity, collaboration, and personal expansion.
But what about your home? Because you don’t have to live in Eywa to experience this level of transformation.
What Makes Eywa Unlike Any Other Place on Earth?
Here’s where things get mind-blowing. Eywa isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about longevity, well-being, and energy alignment.
Every detail has been meticulously designed to nourish the body, expand the mind, and elevate the soul.
1️⃣ The Power of Crystal Energy

At the heart of Eywa lies a 14,000 kg crystal pyramid. Yes, you read that right. Crystals aren’t just for jewelry or “good vibes”—they’ve been used in ancient civilizations to harmonize energy fields. This massive crystal core ensures that the entire building pulses with high-frequency energy.

2️⃣ Living Water for Cellular Rejuvenation
Eywa’s water system replicates Icelandic glacier water, infused with sound vibrations for optimal hydration and cellular health. Imagine every sip of water actively working to slow down aging and boost vitality.
3️⃣ Air So Pure, It’s Like Breathing in a Sacred Forest
Forget standard air purifiers. Eywa’s air system mimics the purity of an operating room, infused with negative ions that cleanse and energize—just like breathing in the fresh air of a deep forest.
4️⃣ Built with Vastu & Biophilic Design
Eywa isn’t just positioned for aesthetics—it’s aligned for energy flow. It follows the same Feng Shui and Vastu Shastra principles that ancient civilizations used to create sacred spaces.

Why Eywa Won World’s Best Property 2024
Eywa didn’t just win this title because it’s luxurious. It won because it redefines luxury.
In a world where most real estate is built for profit, Eywa is built for human evolution.
It’s designed to make you healthier, happier, and more in tune with yourself and the world.
Now here’s how to bring these principles into your own home. 

How to Bring Healing Energy Into Your Home
Not everyone can pack up and move to a high-vibrational sanctuary, but the truth is—you don’t have to. Your home, right now, has the potential to be a space that renews your energy, sharpens your mind, and even supports your longevity. The question is: Is it working for you or against you?
The good news? With just a few intentional shifts, you can transform your space into a source of power, peace, and vitality—one that actively helps you think better, sleep deeper, and feel more alive every day.



So let’s talk about how you can turn your home into a sanctuary for energy, focus, and longevity—without needing a 14,000 kg crystal pyramid (unless you’re into that).
1. Energy Harmonization with Crystals and Feng Shui Directions
Ever notice how some spaces just feel good? That’s because they’re designed to work with energy, not against it. And one of the easiest ways to fine-tune your home’s energy is through crystals and Feng Shui.
Think of crystals as nature’s batteries—constantly emitting frequencies that shift the energy in a space. But here’s the secret: where you place them matters.
Eywa isn’t just decorated with crystals—it’s built with them. The 1,450 semi-precious stones and a 14,000 kg crystal pyramid are embedded throughout the structure, designed to enhance focus, boost longevity, and balance energy.

Here are some tips on using crystals in your own home. 
✔ Want to feel sharper and more focused? Place an Amethyst crystal in your success direction (as per your Feng Shui energy map). It’s known for clearing mental fog and enhancing intuition.
✔ Looking for more love and harmony? Rose Quartz in your relationship direction will soften the energy, creating warmth and balance in your home.
✔ Need protection from negative energy? Place Black Tourmaline by your front door—it acts like an energetic bodyguard, blocking unwanted chaos before it even enters.
And if you want to amplify their effects, add a small water feature nearby. Water enhances energy flow, making your crystals even more powerful.
(Side note: If you’ve ever felt like you just can’t think in a particular room, try shifting objects around—it’s amazing what a little reorganization can do for your mental clarity.)
2. Transform Your Air & Water into Living Elements
Most people obsess over what they eat and drink, but what about what they breathe?
Air and water are two of the biggest factors affecting your health and longevity—yet they’re also the most overlooked.
Let’s start with air quality. If you’re breathing in stale, toxin-filled air, it’s no wonder you feel sluggish. And here’s the kicker—indoor air is often more polluted than outdoor air (thanks to things like furniture off-gassing and chemical cleaners).
The solution? Air-purifying plants. Snake plants, peace lilies, and spider plants aren’t just pretty—they’re nature’s own air filters. Want to supercharge the effect? Invest in a high-quality air purifier to keep your space feeling fresh and light.
Then, there’s water—the foundation of your body’s energy system.
Most tap water is stripped of minerals and vitality—which means that even though you're drinking enough, your cells aren’t fully absorbing it.
A simple upgrade? Structured water systems mimic the way water flows in nature, making it easier for your body to hydrate. Or try this: store your drinking water in a glass container with a crystal inside (like clear quartz or amethyst) and play healing sound frequencies near it. Studies show that water holds memory, meaning it actually responds to sound vibrations.
If this sounds too woo-woo, just try playing 432 Hz frequencies near your water for a few days and see how you feel. You might be surprised.

3. Design to Resemble Nature
Your nervous system craves nature.
For most of human history, we lived in harmony with the earth—but now, we spend 90% of our lives indoors, disconnected from the elements that regulate our energy, mood, and well-being.
The fix? Bring nature back inside.
✔ Fill your space with plants—not just for aesthetics, but because they actively purify the air, balance humidity, and reduce stress.
✔ Maximize natural light exposure during the day (open your windows, rearrange furniture if needed) and switch to warmer, softer lighting at night to keep your circadian rhythms in check.
✔ Swap out synthetic materials for wood, stone, linen, or clay. Your body recognizes natural elements and responds to them in ways you don’t even realize.
Ever notice how a wooden table feels different from a plastic one? That’s because your body actually absorbs the energy of the materials around you. Small shifts—like switching to linen bedsheets or adding a wooden coffee table—can make your home feel instantly more alive.

Here’s an example of the living room at EYWA. Notice how much it resembles nature scenes?



4. Sound & Vibrational Healing with Feng Shui Sound Tools
Have you ever walked into a room and feel like the air is heavy? Like there’s unspoken tension lingering from an argument, or just stagnant energy sitting there?
That’s where sound healing comes in.
Sound is one of the fastest ways to shift the energy of a space. Certain frequencies—like binaural beats, solfeggio tones, and mantras—can literally rewire your brain and body at an energetic level.
✔ Start your mornings with 432 Hz music or Tibetan singing bowls to set a high-frequency tone for the day.
✔ If your space feels heavy, try sound cleansing with chimes, tuning forks, or even simple clapping. (Yep, clapping works—many cultures use this to break up stagnant energy in homes.)
✔ Place a wind chime near your window—this keeps energy flowing naturally throughout the day.
Once you start playing with sound and vibration, you’ll notice how much lighter and clearer your home feels.
Our home should be a multi-sensory experience—one that supports your well-being on every level. At Eywa, the air is infused with scents of ylang-ylang and jasmine, known to promote relaxation and mental clarity. The lighting is soft and golden, mimicking nature’s rhythms. And throughout the space, a gentle hum of 432 Hz vibrational frequencies fills the air, known for its ability to promote healing and emotional balance. This isn’t just design—it’s an intentional tuning of your body’s environment for optimal energy and focus.
5. Vastu Shastra Alignment with Feng Shui Principles
Ever feel restless in your own home—but you can’t quite put your finger on why?
It might not be you—it might be the way your space is arranged.
Vastu Shastra (India’s version of Feng Shui) teaches that even small shifts—like where your bed faces, how your desk is positioned, or where mirrors are placed—can have a huge impact on your energy, focus, and success.
For example:
👉 Your bed should face east or south for deeper, more restorative sleep.
👉 Your workspace should NEVER have your back to the door—it creates subconscious stress and reduces focus.
👉 Mirrors should never face your bed directly—this can disrupt sleep and drain your energy.
Try making a small adjustment today, and see how it feels. You might be surprised at the difference.

Your Home, Your Energy, Your Power
Your home isn’t just a physical space—it’s an extension of your energy.
And every object, material, and layout choice is either supporting your highest potential or subtly holding you back.
But you don’t need to move to a luxury healing retreat or rebuild your house from scratch.
Start small.
🌱 Bring in a plant.
🛏 Move your desk.
🎶 Play healing sounds.
💨 Purify your air and water.
These shifts add up—until your home is no longer just a place you live, but a space that actively nourishes, energizes, and elevates you.
To your highest evolution,
Vishen
