The 8 Goals I Set for My Future Self (And You Should Too)

PREHEAD
How AI, UBI & 3-Day Workweeks Will Reshape Your Goals — And the SoulPACT You Need to Thrive



Something is happening to the world — and it’s happening faster than we think.
I recently attended Singularity University in Palo Alto, and what I learned there genuinely shocked me:
The power of AI is doubling every 3.3 months.
Let’s break that down. 
If something doubles every three months, it becomes 16 times more powerful in one year. In two years, it’s 256 times more powerful. And in five years — thanks to exponential growth — it becomes a million times more powerful.
That means the AI you’re using today — whether it’s ChatGPT or an AI assistant embedded into your workflow — is not just a glimpse of the future. It’s a tiny fragment of what’s coming.
A million times more powerful in five years.
This is why people on the edge of technology are making predictions that seem almost absurd.
Bill Gates recently predicted that the two-day workweek will become the norm.
Elon Musk, speaking in the Middle East, said we are about to enter an era not just of universal basic income — but universal high income. With AI, robotics, and agentic systems, global GDPs could increase by 7x.
This changes everything.
It changes what jobs will exist. It changes how we get paid. It changes where we live. And most importantly, it changes how we set our goals.
Why I Had to Rethink My Entire Approach to Goal-Setting
In a world where billion-dollar companies are being built by teams of less than five… Where everyone works from wherever they want… Where working hours collapse from 50 hours a week to 15 or less…
I had to take a hard look at the way I set goals.
I realized many of my own goals had become… obsolete.
For years, I had goals like:
- Build one of the most beautiful office spaces in the world
- Hire thousands of people
- Scale team operations globally
But in the world we’re entering… These no longer serve me. Or how people want to be employed 
So I re-evaluated. I reflected.
And I rewrote my goals — from scratch.
I didn’t just want productivity goals. I wanted peace goals.
I didn’t just want output goals. I wanted spaciousness and opportunity.
I didn’t just want impact. I wanted authenticity.
And the result became a model I now call SOULPACT.
This is an 8-part model to help you set the right goals for a life where AI is automating the grind, and humans are free to evolve, create, and live in flow.
What is SOULPACT?
SOULPACT is an acronym for:
- Simplicity
- Opportunity
- Uniqueness
- Love
- Purpose
- Abundance
- Calm
- Time
Each pillar represents one category of goals that are essential for a high-performing, meaningful, and future-ready life.
Let’s walk through each one.
By answering the question associated with each of the SOULPACT areas you’re likely to start thinking about your future in a way that matches how the future is really unfolding - and not stuck in career models of the past. 

Ready?
1. Simplicity
In the near future, success won’t be measured by how much you juggle — but by how little you have to manage. Simplicity means removing unnecessary layers, automating what drains you, and focusing only on what matters. It’s about building businesses and careers that are elegant, efficient, and deeply human — not overwhelmed with systems, teams, and clutter. It’s working with 5 people and 10 GPTs instead of 500 people and 0 joy. It’s having the freedom to step away and trust that things run beautifully without you.
The big question: My business is only _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: Your business runs with 1–5 humans and a swarm of AI agents. You have systems that work without micromanagement.
If you’re a solopreneur: You run one signature offer, powered by automation and AI, and you work under 20 hours a week.
If you’re an employee: You only take roles with async workflows, minimal meetings, and outcomes-based performance.
2. Opportunity
When your calendar is packed, your life has no space for magic. Opportunity is about creating enough white space — mentally and logistically — that unexpected blessings can land. It’s being available for the spontaneous call, the brilliant collaborator, the once-in-a-decade invitation. In the AI-powered world, opportunities will multiply exponentially. Your job is to have the space and clarity to say yes to the right ones.
The big question: I create opportunity in my life by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You leave at least two days a week open — no calls, no fires to put out — just space for strategy, connection, and next-level ideas.
If you’re a solopreneur: You keep your Fridays free for growth — whether that’s travel, learning, masterminds, or just thinking.
If you’re an employee: You negotiate flex days or blocks for personal development and explore side projects with long-term potential.
3. Uniqueness
AI will soon be able to replicate almost everything… except your weirdness. Your lived experience. Your soul signature. Your humor, your perspective, your personal story — these become your most valuable assets. Uniqueness is no longer just a personal trait — it’s your economic moat, your cultural value, and your brand. This pillar is about taking what makes you un-copyable and making it central to your life and work.
The big question: I am known for my unique edge in _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You lead with a story, methodology, or style that’s unmistakably yours. Clients come to you because you’re one of a kind.
If you’re a solopreneur: You monetize your weirdness. Your niche is built around your lived experience and energetic signature.
If you’re an employee: You’re the go-to person for something no one else can do like you — and your personal brand reflects it.
4. Love (Passion)
This isn’t about romance. It’s about doing what lights you up in the world. Passion used to be something you squeezed into weekends. Now, in the AI era, where your operational burdens can be outsourced, your joy becomes your compass. Love is the source of your creativity, your contribution, and your renewal. It’s where flow begins. And often, the thing you love — the thing you’d do even without pay — is the thing that changes your life the most. The world doesn’t just need more strategy. It needs more soul.
The big question: I follow what I love by regularly _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You devote 10% of your time and team capacity to passion-led projects — even if they don’t make money right away.
If you’re a solopreneur: You create one purely joyful offering a year — a retreat, a community, a piece of art — just because.
If you’re an employee: You spend one evening or weekend morning a week pursuing something that excites you — whether it’s writing, martial arts, painting, or launching that podcast.

5. Purpose
Work that doesn’t serve others eventually drains you. In a world where AI handles tasks, the human role is to uplift, inspire, and heal. Purpose is about turning your gifts into something that makes the world a little lighter, a little smarter, a little more loving. It’s about ensuring your calendar — and your career — echo beyond yourself. Because people don’t just remember what you built. They remember how you made them feel.
The big question: I contribute to the world by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You use your platform to solve problems that matter — through donations, education, or meaningful change.
If you’re a solopreneur: You give a portion of your time or income to impact causes — and your content helps elevate others.
If you’re an employee: You seek out purpose-driven companies or carve a meaningful mission within your current role.
6. Abundance
In the near future, money will flow in new ways — passive, automated, and creatively earned. Abundance is no longer about grinding harder. It’s about aligning with the flow of life and receiving with joy. It means defining how much is truly “enough” — and designing your income around ease, joy, and alignment. The new rich? They’re not the ones earning the most. They’re the ones who earn joyfully and live well.
The big question: I will earn $_____ per year in a fun and easy way by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You design your business model around recurring, passive, or high-leverage income.
If you’re a solopreneur: You license your knowledge or build scalable products so you earn while you sleep.
If you’re an employee: You upskill and negotiate roles with both salary and side income potential — from consulting, royalties, or speaking.
7. Calm
In a world that moves at machine speed, your nervous system becomes your true superpower. Calm isn’t passive — it’s potent. It gives you clarity, discernment, and presence. It helps you make better decisions and show up as your best self. When AI does the heavy lifting, your job is to be grounded, wise, and emotionally clear. Calm is the soil where all other goals grow.
The big question: I take care of my body and protect my energy by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You integrate nervous system care into your workweek — from breathwork to off-grid days.
If you’re a solopreneur: You schedule calm as part of your productivity stack — with rituals that restore and realign.
If you’re an employee: You build boundaries and request the flexibility to protect your mornings, your mental health, and your rest.
8. Time
Time is no longer how we prove our worth. It’s how we reclaim our lives. In a world of AI-powered efficiency, time becomes your most sacred currency. You’ll work fewer hours — but with more focus, intention, and creativity. A life built around time freedom isn’t just more enjoyable. It’s more productive, more visionary, and more human. Design your week like your life depends on it. Because it does.
The big question: I only work _____ hours a week by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You work 15–20 hours a week and delegate everything outside your zone of genius.
If you’re a solopreneur: You batch your creative time and unplug for full days to restore and dream.
If you’re an employee: You negotiate a 4-day workweek or output-based contracts — and protect evenings and weekends.
