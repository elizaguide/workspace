BLOG: An Open Letter to America – From Someone Who Still Believes in You… But Can No Longer Stay Silent

Dear America,
I want to begin with this:
I love you.
I really, truly do.
I lived in your cities. I walked your campuses. I sat in your coffee shops, dreaming of building something that could change the world.
America was where I studied. Where I discovered my voice.
Where I fell in love with ideas that reshaped my life.
Where I started Mindvalley, with nothing but ambition and a belief that anything was possible.
For a full decade, you were my home.
 And in many ways, you still are.
 I may live elsewhere now, but I still identify as American more than anything else.
Because America — the idea of America — isn’t just geography.
 It’s a frequency. A dream. A promise that inspired not just me, but billions of people around the world.



🌟 What We Loved About You
We loved your optimism — the way you believed anything was possible.
 We loved your rebels — the ones who spoke truth to power and rewrote the rules.
We loved your Martin Luther King Jr., whose voice still echoes across continents.
 We loved your Silicon Valley, that dared to invent the future.
 We loved your Apple, born in a garage, changing the way we connect.
 We loved Burning Man, a wild celebration of freedom, creativity, and community in the desert.
 We loved your poets, your scientists, your dreamers.
You were never perfect. But damn — you had soul.
You were the lighthouse.
 The messy, brilliant, complicated beacon we looked toward for what was possible.
But lately… that light feels like it’s flickering.

🌍 What the World Sees Now
In just six months, this is what the world has seen:
– Threats to abandon NATO, the alliance that preserved peace for generations.
– Pointless trade wars where everyone loses.
– Withdrawal from the Paris Climate Treaty, while the Earth burns.
– And now — bombs falling on Iran.
Another unwinnable war in the Middle East.
A war your people swore they’d never allow again.
Not after Iraq.
Not after Afghanistan.
And it's not just the outer world we see you destroy.
We see you tearing yourselves apart from within. 
- Immigration raids that tear apart families and have caused LA to burn.
- 
- Politicians who sound like children while openly taking bribes.
- 
- Tax cuts for billionaires, while those struggling now actually have to pay more in taxes.
- 
- A climate movement abandoned by the very country where it was born.
- 
And yet — I’m writing this letter with an open heart.
Because I haven't given up.
This week, I'm helping my son apply to U.S. universities. We're preparing for a tour of East Coast campuses.  Then, I’m driving from South Dakota to Yosemite, with stops at Mount Rushmore and the great open spaces I fell in love with.
I want to show my son America. Because I still believe in what America can be. 
But I also cannot stay silent — not as a lover of your culture, not as a global citizen.
This spiral you're in?
It must be named. And it must be stopped.
Because true friends don’t stay silent when they see you crashing.
🧠 The Spiral Was Not a Mystery. It Was a Choice.
Every war.
 Every broken treaty.
 Every erosion of trust.
It didn’t just happen. It was chosen — through voting decisions.
By people who, often unknowingly, chose:
- Ego over empathy.
- 
- Charisma over character.
- 
- Soundbites over substance.
- 
And I don’t blame you.
 You were caught in a storm of propaganda. You were tired, misled, afraid.
But we need to be honest:
When you vote for leaders who enable war, destabilize peace, and govern through vengeance — you are not just voting for policy. You are voting for self-destruction.
🇺🇸 What Happened to Service?
A great American president once said:
“Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.” – John F. Kennedy
Another said:
“We must never remain silent in the face of injustice.” – Barack Obama
Even Ronald Reagan once called America a “shining city upon a hill.”
What happened to that America?
Now we see leaders who sow division instead of unity.
 Who thrive on conflict rather than compassion.
 Who look not to serve, but to rule.
And as Sun Tzu warned:
“Some men would set their own nation ablaze, just to be king over the ashes.”
Can you recognize them?
Because now more than ever, you must.
🎬 America, You’ve Always Known How to Tell the Story. Now It’s Time to Live It.
Think of your heroes.
 The ones you’ve shown us on screen for decades.
Will Smith in Independence Day.
 Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.
 They save the world, not just themselves.
 They protect their families — but they also rise to a higher mission.
That’s what made us fall in love with you.
 Your heroes were never selfish.
They were flawed, yes. But they stood up for something bigger.
So why, in real life, do you so often vote for the opposite?

🌎 Your Vote Is Not Just Yours
I say this with love — and urgency:
Your vote doesn’t just affect your neighborhood. It affects the entire planet.
- It affects the air we all breathe.
- 
- The treaties we all depend on.
- 
- The peace we all hope for.
- 
- The future our children will inherit.
- 
This is no longer about party loyalty or economic policy.
This is about consciousness.
This is about whether the most powerful country on Earth will continue to operate from fear and ego —

Or rise into wisdom and service.

🌎 What the World Needs From You Now
We don’t need another American empire.
 We need an American elder.
Not one who dominates. One who guides.
 Not one who fears. One who serves.
Because you were never meant to be a fortress.
You were meant to be a lighthouse.
But a lighthouse cannot fulfill its purpose if it forgets to shine inward first.



🙏 You Taught Us to Dream. Now We’re Asking You to Dream Again.
The world doesn’t hate you.
 We’re not laughing at you.
We’re just watching… and hoping.
 Hoping that the America we believed in is still in there.
The next time you march in the streets,
March for all of us.
Not just for the poor or hungry in your zip code —
But for the citizens of our shared planet who need you to shine again.
And when the time comes…
Vote with your heart. And with your higher self.
🔥 The Choice Is Yours
Not every election is a turning point.
But some are.
And the one you're facing now?
This is that moment.
You can vote for leaders who turn the world into a battlefield.
 Or vote for those who understand that true power is service.
You can choose:
- Ego or evolution
- 
- Division or destiny
- 
- Fear or future
- 
The world is not asking you to be perfect.
We are simply asking you to remember who you are — at your best.
The America that marched with MLK.
 That wrote the Moonshot speech.
 That created iPhones, NASA, jazz, and the dream that all humans are created equal.
That’s the America we still believe in.
That’s the America the world needs.
Let that be the America you choose.

PS: This letter isn’t just mine — it’s a conversation we all need to have. I’d love to hear how this landed for you. What do you believe America still stands for? What does it need to stand for?
