Subject: How Paul McKenna Helped Me Lower My Stress Baseline (Free Gift Inside)

Preheader: A free hypnosis track that rewires your stress response + a rare 4-hour LIVE seminar with Paul McKenna.
Blog Title: How to rewire your brain to be stress proof.

Today, We’re Doing Something Different.
Normally, in my Tuesday newsletters, I share ideas, insights, and practices for upgrading your life. But today, I want to do something more direct. Instead of giving you words, I want to give you an experience.
In fact, I want to give you the single most transformative audio track I’ve come across in years.
It’s called Hypnotic Trance Bliss by Paul McKenna.
And here’s the thing: in 2024, this track was voted Best Audio of the Year by the Mindvalley community. Out of hundreds of meditations, sound journeys, and breathwork practices — this one stood out.
For the next two weeks, I’m making it free for you to access.



Why This Track Is Different
This isn’t just a meditation. It’s a piece of advanced hypnotherapy technology.
Paul’s method rewires your subconscious to lower your baseline stress level. That means you don’t just feel calm during the session — your entire nervous system resets. Stressful situations suddenly feel easier. Emotional triggers lose their bite. What used to feel overwhelming becomes fluid, manageable… even enjoyable.
Paul prescribes it like this:

 🎧 Listen 5 days in a row.
 💡 Watch what happens next.
Here’s what our members report (and what I experienced myself):
- Stress dissolves.
- 
- Emotional steadiness increases.
- 
- You stay calm, clear, and focused under pressure.
- 
- Old triggers stop hijacking your day.
- 
- The benefits last for months, sometimes years, after repeated listening.

Now before you start, you need to know the story and context behind this track. 

How I Stumbled Into the Power of Hypnosis


Here’s the funny part: I didn’t even discover this track myself.
One day in 2022, my team kept blowing up my phone with messages:
“This is the most powerful meditation I’ve ever done.”
 “The greatest audio on the app, hands down.”
And I’m thinking, Really? Out of the thousands of audios in the Mindvalley library?
Now, confession: I don’t personally test every single track in the app anymore. There’s too much content. So ironically, I didn’t even hear about this from Paul directly. I heard it from my own team.
So I did what Paul suggested. I committed to 5 days in a row.
Here’s what happened:
- I felt lighter, even when facing pressure.
- 
- My anxiety shrank.
- 
- I could juggle multiple projects without tipping into stress mode.
- 
- My mind stayed sharp, and my body stayed calm.
- 
- My decisions were quicker and better.
- 
That’s when it hit me:

 👉 It’s not the workload that burns us out. It’s the subconscious programming beneath it.
This is why I wanted to include this hypnotherapy track in today’s newsletter as a free gift for all of you.

Hypnotic Trance Bliss Wins Audio Track of the Year 
 In 2024, Paul McKenna’s Hypnotic Trance Bliss was awarded Meditation of the Year —chosen by our community of millions who had experienced its power.


But here’s the thing: what you just listened to isn’t just a meditation—it’s a glimpse into the power of hypnotherapy.
Why It Works
Paul doesn’t just talk to your conscious mind. He bypasses it.
Here’s how:
- Different commands go into your left and right ears.
- 
- Strange stories and riddles distract your logical brain.
- 
- Your conscious mind is too busy trying to “figure it out.”
- 
- Meanwhile, your subconscious just absorbs the transformation.
- 
It feels unusual. Sometimes a little weird. But that’s the point.
The old stress programs get overwritten — and you emerge into what Paul calls relaxed alertness. Calm, sharp, productive, fully present.

The McKenna-Mindvalley School of Hypnotherapy
Paul’s work has transformed my life—and the lives of thousands in our community.
A couple of years ago, we decided to take it further.
That’s why Mindvalley partnered with Paul to create the McKenna Mindvalley School of Hypnotherapy: a global training ground for mastering the art of transformation.

Why hypnotherapy?
Because science, psychology, and experience all point to one truth:
It’s not your conscious mind that runs the show. It’s your subconscious.
And when you learn to reprogram the subconscious, everything shifts—your health, your wealth, your confidence, even your relationships.
The Subconscious Is Running Your Life

If your conscious mind is the tip of the iceberg—willpower, logic, emotions, short-term memory—then your subconscious is the massive structure beneath the surface that’s far more powerful:
- Your beliefs and phobias
- 
- Your cravings and addictions
- 
- Your imagination and intuition
- 
- Your unresolved grief and fears of abandonment
- 
- Your long-term memory and protective reactions
- 
In other words: while your conscious mind thinks it’s in charge, your subconscious is the one quietly steering the ship.
This is why so many of our struggles—around money, food, confidence, even relationships—don’t change through “trying harder.”
They only change when we rewire the subconscious.
Now, let’s go deeper, 
What’s really affecting your subconscious? 
Your Stress: A Baseline On How Much Stress You Can Take Is the Silent Saboteur
When Paul joined me on The Mindvalley Show, he broke it down brilliantly:
- Stress is situational. A presentation. A deadline. Traffic.
- 
- Anxiety is ambient. That hum of dread that never switches off.
Here’s the problem: we’ve practiced stress and anxiety so much—through news, uncertainty, constant change—that our baseline is too high.
And when your baseline is high, everything feels harder:
- Creativity shrinks.
- 
- Joy disappears.
- 
- Bandwidth collapses.
The solution isn’t to remove all pressure.
It’s to reset your baseline—so you live in what Paul calls relaxed alertness.
That’s the state where you stay calm, but razor sharp. 
Productive, without panic.
Present, without drained energy.
You Don’t Lose Your Edge—You Gain Flow
High performers resist change because they fear losing their edge.
For years, my “remedy” for stress was a glass of wine.
It felt good at the moment. 
But brain scans, new research, and my own experiments proved the opposite: alcohol was raising my baseline stress, dulling my focus, and aging my brain.
The same goes for sugar, overworking, or compulsive scrolling.
Short-term relief, long-term damage.
We call them “calm.” But they’re really chains.
Listening to Paul’s Hypnotic Trance Bliss changed things.
I didn’t lose my ambition—I amplified it.
And this is the paradox: when you’re less tense, you’re more effective.
When you’re less stressed, you create more.
When you’re calmer, you lead better.
The more I practiced, the more I realized:
Our world desperately needs more people trained in hypnotherapy.
Not just for personal breakthroughs, but for helping others:
- Clearing phobias
- 
- Breaking addictions
- 
- Unlocking confidence
- 
- Healing stress and burnout
Which is why I’m thrilled to share this with you:
