Blog Sub: In 5 Years, AI Will Be 1 MILLION TIMES More Powerful. Here’s What That Means.

AI Isn’t Here to Replace You. It’s Here to Reveal You. 
By Vishen Lakhiani 

We’re entering a new era of human progress. Call it evolution, call it disruption, call it a revolution in intelligence. But here’s what I believe to my core:
We’re entering the most profound disruption in human work since the invention of electricity.
And AI? It’s not here to replace you.
It’s here to reveal the most powerful version of you the world has never seen.
The way we learn, create, express, and even heal is about to be radically transformed. And if we learn how to partner with this new intelligence, the future becomes not something to fear—but something profoundly beautiful.
Welcome to the age of the Human Colossus.

Why This Is Personal to Me
I’ve always believed that real transformation happens at the intersection of technology and consciousness.
Yes, I started in engineering. I graduated from the top 5 ranked computer engineering school, The University of Michigan School of Engineering with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Then I burned out. I walked away from Silicon Valley and became a meditation teacher. I dove into altered states, flow science, healing, manifestation.
But the love for tech never left me.
So when I returned to the world of innovation, it wasn’t as a coder—it was as a consciousness explorer with an engineer’s mind.
That’s how Mindvalley was born: not as a personal growth company, but as a bridge between soul and system.
And now, AI is the most powerful bridge I’ve ever seen.
At Mindvalley, we’ve always been about the mind, body, and soul. So why would we embrace artificial intelligence?
Because AI is no longer just about code and machines. It’s about conscious amplification. Waking up a version of you who’s more creative, more present, more alive.
Used right, AI becomes your sidekick for self-actualization.
 It helps you:
- Think more clearly
- 
- Create more powerfully
- 
- Heal more precisely
- 
- And ultimately, live with more time, joy, and freedom
But most of us are barely scratching the surface and 99% of us are unprepared for what is about to come. 
I recently got back from Singularity University in Palo Alto. It’s a 5 day program designed to prepare executives for exponential tech that’s coming up in the future. And this graph stunned me.
It shows that AI is doubling in power to cost ratio EVERY 3.3 months. 


What does this mean?
In one year the AI you use will be 16X as powerful. 
In two years this doubles 4 times again. It’s now 256 times as powerful. 
In Year 5 - it will have completed 20 doublings. It’s grown exponentially. 
It’s now ONE MILLION times as powerful. 
The world as we know it is about to change so dramatically most of us can't wrap our minds around it. This is the single biggest issue we need to address in government and politics today but most politicians don’t even see it coming. 
From Campfires to Code: The Rise of Human Intelligence
Let’s zoom out.
For most of human history, we passed on wisdom through stories around campfires. Then came writing, and with it—memory beyond mortality. 
Paper allowed us to preserve ideas across generations. Suddenly, humanity became time-agnostic.
You can read the Odyssey today because someone once picked up a pen thousands of years ago.
But even then, people were worried.
When writing was invented, Socrates warned it would damage our memory. He feared we’d rely too much on written words and lose our internal capacity for retention.
And yet, we evolved.
Google Was Just the Beginning
Fast forward.
The internet came along and cracked open the vault of human knowledge. Billions of pages, instantly accessible.
But that created a new problem—too much information.
Let’s say you search: “What kind of magnesium helps with sleep?”
Google gives you 10 million articles.
Now what?
That’s where AI changes the game. Ask ChatGPT, and it might respond:
“Magnesium glycinate is commonly used for sleep. But have you experienced bloating from it? Have you tried magnesium chloride instead?”
Suddenly, you're not sifting through the noise—you're in a conversation. 
A co-creative, intelligent, and personalized dialogue. It adapts. It listens. It evolves.
This is not a search. This is the birth of the Human Colossus.
Tim Urban’s Vision of the Future
The thinker Tim Urban called it exactly that: The Human Colossus.
In an article on his famous blog WaitButWhy.com he wrote:
The better we could communicate on a mass scale, the more our species began to function like a single organism, with humanity’s collective knowledge tower as its brain and each individual human brain like a nerve or a muscle fiber in its body. With the era of mass communication upon us, the collective human organism—the Human Colossus—rose into existence.
Imagine this: one unified being, made of billions of connected human minds, accessing every known book, podcast, article, study, or story.
AI isn’t some alien intelligence.
It’s us—collectively connected, pattern-aware, and evolving faster than ever before.
It’s the grand sum of all our artists, scientists, ancestors, and healers.
We’re not outsourcing our intelligence—we’re expanding it. Together.
How Intelligent is Artificial Intelligence?
Here’s where it gets wild.
Just recently, researchers fed an AI model thousands of images of eyeballs.
The AI could predict—with over 80% accuracy—whether the eye belonged to a male or female.
Humans had no idea there were visual differences in male vs. female eyes. But an AI found a pattern. 
The research group trained a deep neural model to scan 20,000 fundus retinal photos (the inner eye, including blood vessels and the retina). After processing, AI reached a record 96.83% accuracy in predicting gender, with near-perfect values for both recall and precision.

It spotted patterns invisible to the naked eye.
If it can do that with retinas, what can it do with MRIs?
 With cancer detection?
 With genetic conditions?
This is where AI becomes life-saving.
 It won’t just improve healthcare—it will extend human life.
And since it’s doubling in power every 3.3 months - this means it’s going to get better and cheaper at an astonishing rate. 

Our Mind Does Not Grasp Exponentials. 
Let’s talk about how fast this is happening.
Would you rather have:
- $1 million today?
- 
- Or $1 that doubles every day for 21 days?
- 
Most would choose the million. But here’s what happens:
- Day 1: $1
- 
- Day 2: $2
- 
- Day 3: $4
- 
- …
- 
- Day 20: $1 million
- 
- Day 21: $2 million
- 
That’s exponential growth. And it’s how AI is evolving.
AI Doubles Every 3.3 Months
Right now, AI’s cost-to-performance ratio is doubling every 3.3 months. That means:
- In 1 year: 16x better
- 
- In 2 years: 256x better
- 
- In 5 years: 1,000,000x more powerful
- 
Think about that.
The ChatGPT or Claude you're using today?
 In five years, it will be a million times better—and cheaper.
That’s not evolution. That’s transcendence.
Welcome to the 2-Day Work Week
So what does this mean for you?
It means a future where:
- You work 2 days a week
- 
- You rest, learn, and create the other 5
- 
- You spend more time with your kids, your health, your dreams
- 
- You reclaim your time
- 
Yes, there will be disruptions. Industries will collapse. Jobs will vanish.
But I am convinced humanity will be better off. 
But if you understand how to partner with AI, you’ll rise above the chaos. You’ll surf the wave while others are swept away.

Before the Summit begins, I want to give you one exercise: 
Go to ChatGPT and say: “Help me write a letter from my future self.”
Use this prompt. Copy and paste below. 

“Write a letter from my future self to my present self.
 My future self has just gone through a powerful journey of mastering AI—learning how to use it to amplify my creativity, automate my work, improve my health, expand my consciousness, and free up time to focus on what truly matters.
Start the letter with ‘Dear [Your Name], it’s amazing how far you’ve come…’
In this letter, tell me:
 – What I’ve created using AI
 – Who I’ve become
 – What I’ve unlocked in terms of growth, time, income, or creativity
 – What I’ve let go of (limiting beliefs, habits, or fears)
 – What my life looks like now
Make the tone inspiring, visionary, and a bit poetic—but still grounded in possibility.”
It might just show you the future that’s waiting for you.

Let’s evolve—together, faster. 
See you at Mindvalley’s 3rd Annual AI Summit this weekend. Our biggest event every year.
