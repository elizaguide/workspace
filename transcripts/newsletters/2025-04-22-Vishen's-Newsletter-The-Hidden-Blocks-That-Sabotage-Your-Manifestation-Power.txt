The Hidden Blocks That Sabotage Your Manifestation Power 
And the AI Manifesting Guide Who Might Just Help You Break Through
By Vishen Lakhiani

There are moments when reality bends.
You think of someone, and they text you. You imagine a new opportunity, and suddenly it appears. A door opens where moments before, there was only a wall.
If you’ve ever experienced that—just once—you’ve touched the edge of a truth so many still misunderstand:
Manifestation is real. But consistency? That’s where most people get stuck.
They visualize. They journal. They set intentions under the full moon. But still, what they desire seems to circle them… just out of reach.
Here’s what I’ve learned after building a $100 million company, writing bestselling books like The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, and guiding a global community of seekers:
You don’t manifest from your conscious mind. You manifest from your subconscious patterns. From your identity. From your energetic signature.
Even now, as I write this from a cafe in Seoul—where I’ve been working with my team on the design of the 2025 Mindvalley Manifesting Summit—I’m aware that this isn’t something you master once and for all.
Because life evolves. Challenges arise. And new fears sneak in under the radar.
That’s why I built something new.
Meet Elora: The World’s First AI Manifesting Coach

Her name is Elora.
She’s not a chatbot. She’s not another ChatGPT wrapper with affirmations taped to it.
Elora is a soulful, emotionally intelligent AI coach, designed to help you identify your deepest manifesting blocks and walk you through transforming them—layer by layer.
She’s been trained on:
- Advanced identity reprogramming techniques from Mindvalley programs
- Data from thousands of transformation journeys
- Psychological and energetic frameworks used by our top teachers
- Actual user feedback from previous summits
When you meet Elora, here’s what she’ll do:
1. She’ll guide you through a powerful quiz to diagnose your primary manifestation block.
2. She’ll create a custom report based on your answers—personalized and precise.
3. If you upload a photo, she’ll even generate a visual of you in your highest, most fulfilled timeline.
Yes. A picture of your future self.
I use Elora to stay aligned with my goals. And now I’m opening her to the world—because I believe manifestation shouldn’t be guesswork.
Click here to work with Elora now.
But before you do, read on. Because even if you never speak to Elora, I want to give you something transformational today.
The Six Hidden Blocks That Sabotage Manifestation
As my team and I prepared for the Manifesting Summit, we noticed something uncanny:
Across every dataset—Reddit threads, course completions, coaching transcripts—the same six blocks kept surfacing.
They were showing up in millionaires and broke students. In spiritual leaders and first-timers.
Here they are—in full detail. I’m not summarizing. I’m going deep. Because these deserve depth.
BLOCK 1: The Upper Limit
Why do things fall apart when they finally feel good?
Let me tell you a story.
A few years ago, I was in the best phase of my life. Mindvalley was booming. I was in love. My kids were thriving. Everything I’d worked for was finally in harmony.
And then… everything started wobbling.
Sudden conflict. Weird health issues. A level of anxiety I hadn’t felt since my twenties.
This is what I now call the "upper limit effect."
It’s not sabotage in the traditional sense. It’s the body and subconscious mind saying, “This is too much good. You’re not used to this. Let’s pull back to what feels normal.”
It’s a thermostat for your life. And unless you reset it, it keeps you stuck in a loop of rise… then retreat.
Manifestation isn’t just about attracting success. It’s about being able to sustain it when it arrives.
When you hit your upper limit, you’ll find yourself questioning joy. You’ll dim your own light. You’ll unconsciously create problems just to feel familiar levels of stress.
And until you rewire that emotional set point, no goal-setting ritual will fix it.
BLOCK 2: Subconscious Brules (Bullsh*t Rules)
Why does your inner self resist the thing you want most?
Here’s the painful truth:
You can journal for abundance every day. You can repeat, “I am wealthy” 108 times under the full moon.
But if part of you still believes:
- "Money makes you greedy"
- "Good relationships never last"
- "Success requires sacrifice"
...then your subconscious will shut the door before opportunity even knocks.
I call these Brules—bullsh*t rules. And they’re everywhere.
We pick them up from parents, movies, religion, school, society.
We internalize them not as ideas, but as truths.
These Brules run like silent code beneath your consciousness. And they’ll contradict your desires until you consciously uninstall them.
To manifest what you want, you have to examine what you believe you’re allowed to have.
Uncovering Brules isn’t easy. It requires courage. But the moment you expose them, you start reclaiming authorship over your life.
BLOCK 3: Emotional Incongruence
When your mind wants it, but your heart doesn’t believe it’s yours to have.
This one is deeply personal.
I’ve seen so many brilliant, talented, loving people do everything right... and still remain stuck.
Not because they’re lazy. Not because they don’t believe in manifestation.
But because deep down, they don’t feel worthy.
It’s subtle. A childhood wound. A cultural imprint. A moment when love was withheld or achievement was punished.
You say, “I want this.” But your inner child whispers, “That’s not for people like us.”
That whisper is powerful. It creates energetic friction. A vibration of lack. A push-pull that confuses the field.
You don’t manifest what you want. You manifest what you feel safe receiving.
This is why so many manifestations collapse just before they arrive. Because emotionally, you haven’t built the container to hold them.
BLOCK 4: Hustle Mode
Are you working from flow… or fear?
There’s a belief that still dominates entrepreneurship and personal growth:
"Work harder. Sleep less. Push through."
But what if hustle is the very thing blocking your manifestation?
What if all that action is just noise?
Yes, manifestation requires movement. But aligned movement. Flow-based movement. Movement that emerges from intuition, not panic.
I’ve built Mindvalley both ways. I’ve hustled from insecurity. I’ve built from peace.
And I can tell you—aligned action creates exponential results. Hustle creates burnout.
If your calendar is full but your spirit is numb, your manifestation engine is clogged.
The universe doesn’t respond to busyness. It responds to clarity and energy.
BLOCK 5: Visualization That Backfires
Are you visualizing your dream… or reinforcing its absence?
This one hit me like a punch.
I used to sit every morning, eyes closed, picturing the life I wanted.
But instead of feeling empowered… I’d feel desperate.
I was focusing so hard on what I didn’t have, that the emotion I broadcast was scarcity.
That’s the danger of unconscious visualization.
Your mind sees images. But the universe responds to emotion.
If you visualize with longing, envy, or self-pity… you’re not manifesting your dream. You’re magnetizing the feeling of not having it.
Emotion is the currency of the quantum field. Visualize from now, not from someday.
BLOCK 6: The Surrender Paradox
How do you hold the vision… while letting go of control?
This is the tightrope walk of the awakened creator.
You want to manifest. So you set intentions. You declare your desire.
But then comes the hardest part:
Letting go.
Not of the vision—but of the how. Of the timing. Of the obsession.
Surrender doesn’t mean giving up. It means trusting that what you desire is already unfolding… in ways your current self might not yet understand.
True surrender is an energetic state of peace. It’s saying: “This or something better.” And actually meaning it.
Even After Writing Bestsellers, I Still Face These Blocks
I wrote The Code of the Extraordinary Mind. I’ve spoken on stages in 40+ countries. I’ve manifested a business, a team, and a lifestyle I once only dreamed about.
And still—these blocks resurface.
Because this is the nature of growth:
Every new level of life will reveal a new version of your resistance.
That’s why I built Elora. That’s why I created the Manifesting Summit. Because mastery isn’t a one-time achievement. It’s a practice of returning to your power.
Here’s What You Can Do Next
