Blog Header: I Let My AI Clone Interview Me. What Happened Next Was Hilarious (And a Little Unsettling)
Blog image: 

Subject Line: My AI Clone Is Here (And It Has Opinions)
Pre-Header: A three-minute video. A surreal conversation. And a glimpse into the future of human + AI.

I know this is going to trigger some of you, but I'm about to launch an AI clone of myself.
You'll be able to interact with a version of me that looks like me, talks to you, answers your questions with patience and empathy—even compliments you on what you're wearing.
This AI clone is built from new technology and we'll be sharing this technology to show you how you can create your own digital clone at Mindvalley's AI Summit. 
That can help your clients if you happen to be a coach or a speaker
But for now, forget everything you read above—because you have to see it to believe it.
I want you to watch this three-minute, quirky video that people are saying is probably the funniest, weirdest video I’ve ever created.
It is what happens when my AI clone actually interviews me.
And I hope it makes you laugh.

[👉 Watch the Video Here ]

And after you’ve watched it, come back and tell me what you think.
Did it make you laugh? Cringe? Rethink the future of AI and consciousness?
🧠 Drop your thoughts in the comments on the blog — I read every one.

AI Summit this year is bigger than ever
With incredible new speakers joining us to teach like Cassie Kozyrkov, Noelle Russell, and Nick Sonnenberg.

Plus, we’ve got award-winning Manon Dave teaching AI-driven music creation who is dropping a brand-new track online with Snoop Dog.
 
This is going to be a mind-bending experience.

Can’t wait to see you there—glitch and all. 😉
Stay real,

 — Vishen
