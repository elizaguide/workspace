🌟 The 8 Most Important “Mindsets” to Reach Your Goals
By Vishen Lakhiani
Today I want to share something that’s been brewing in my mind for a while now.
Over the years, I’ve had thousands of conversations with Mindvalley members from every corner of the world.

Some happen in formal settings — retreats, masterminds, virtual events.

Others catch me off guard — like the Uber driver I met just yesterday, who turned around mid-ride and said,



“Wait… are you Vishen? I read the book ‘The Silva Method’ when I saw you recommended it on Youtube.”
To know how Silva Techniques have been helping this man’s life: 
Check out my story on Instagram 


We ended up having a 15-minute conversation about intuition, the feeling of being stuck between chapters, and how Silva Method changed his life.
That kind of thing happens all the time.
And whether I’m walking through an airport, grabbing coffee in Amsterdam, or reading DMs at 2AM, I’ve noticed something fascinating:
The same patterns keep surfacing.
The same questions. The same breakthroughs. And more importantly — the same blocks.
So I wanted to write this. Not as a hype piece. Not as a checklist. But as a kind of mirror.
Because one of the most powerful ways to move past a barrier is to see the pattern inside it.
When we name the pattern, we take away its power. When we recognize the loop, we reclaim the choice to step out of it.
So what follows are the eight most important shifts I believe people need to make when it comes to manifesting dreams and moving toward goals — based on years of observation, teaching, and real human connection.
These are the breakthroughs we’ll help you activate and embody at the Manifesting Summit 2025 in LA. But even before then, I want you to read this carefully.
Because you might just recognize something in yourself — a thread, a story, a belief — that’s finally ready to be released.
Let’s dive in.
✨ 1. Design a Reality That Feels Inevitable
Activate your brain’s GPS and turn dreams into directives.
What if visualizing your future wasn’t just a daydream—but a neurological instruction?
In this training, you’ll learn how to use emotion-first visualization to activate your Reticular Activating System (RAS)—the part of your brain responsible for filtering what you notice, attract, and act on. By combining vivid mental imagery with elevated emotion, you reprogram your subconscious to believe your future is already in motion.
🧠 Based on teachings from Dr. Joe Dispenza and myself, this approach helps your body and brain expect the future you desire—so it stops feeling far away and starts feeling inevitable.
You’ll walk away with: A powerful blueprinting method that primes your brain to seek, notice, and act on synchronicities aligned with your desires.
🔥 2. Manifest Without the Hustle
Break the addiction to pressure. Attract from peace, not push.
If you’ve ever felt like you have to earn your dreams through stress, over-effort, or 24/7 hustle—you’re not alone.
This part of the journey helps you unhook from the outdated belief that “hard = worthy.” You’ll explore how to shift from force to flow by acting from alignment, not fear. Learn how to follow intuitive nudges, trust the unseen, and allow your energy to do the heavy lifting.
🌊 Inspired by Regan Hillyer’s surrendered manifestation and the Warrior-to-Mystic archetype shift, this lesson rewires how you relate to action.
You’ll walk away with: A new relationship to productivity where action feels inspired, not exhausting—and where results happen with more ease than effort.
⚡ 3. Collapse Time Through Frequency Alignment
Quantum leap into the future version of you.
Time doesn’t move at one speed. When you align your frequency—your thoughts, emotions, and identity—with the reality you desire, you compress timelines. This is how the unexplainable happens: the “impossible” job offer, the soulmate encounter, the business success that came “out of nowhere.”
You’ll learn the Alignment Trifecta: Identity, Intention, and Frequency—and how mastering this triangle bends the rules of how fast things come to you.
🌀 This process draws from quantum energetics (Dispenza), vibrational law (Ghiyam), and identity re-coding (Nafousi)—all proven to accelerate results.
You’ll walk away with: A personal method to embody your future now—and watch time catch up to the version of you who already has it.
🧱 4. Break the Invisible Blocks
Remove the subconscious resistance you don’t even know you have.
Most manifesting methods fail because they only work on the surface. But true breakthroughs require digging into the programs running in the background—like:
- Feeling unworthy of what you want
- 
- Fear of being seen, successful, or “too much”
- 
- Belief systems inherited from family, culture, or trauma
- 
- The Upper Limit Problem (self-sabotage when things go too well)
- 
You’ll learn how to recognize and dissolve these hidden patterns using a blend of psychology, spiritual practice, and energy work.
🧬 Based on the deepest summit research into Brules, identity wounds, and self-protection patterns.
You’ll walk away with: Clarity around what’s really been holding you back—and tools to rewrite it for good.
🪞 5. Recode Your Self-Identity
Upgrade the inner blueprint that defines what you’re allowed to receive.
Here’s the secret: You don’t manifest what you want.
 You manifest what you believe you are.
This part of the journey helps you shift the most powerful force in manifestation: your self-concept. You’ll learn how to consciously evolve your identity into the version of you that already receives love, abundance, visibility, and joy—without guilt, hiding, or sabotage.
💫 This teaching draws from identity psychology (Roxie Nafousi), coherence science (Dr. Joe), and soul embodiment practices (Regan Hillyer).
You’ll walk away with: The internal permission slip to be who you came here to be—bold, radiant, and unstoppable.
🌺 6. Embody Abundance Every Day
Make high-vibration living your new normal.
Manifestation isn’t something you do once. It’s something you become.
This session teaches you the micro-habits, somatic rituals, and energy hygiene practices that help you lock in abundance as a daily frequency—not just a peak moment. You’ll learn how to manage your emotional setpoint, shift your vibe on command, and re-center yourself even when life wobbles.
🌞 Based on Qi Gong, subconscious priming, and emotional regulation models from teachers like Lee Holden and David Ghiyam.
You’ll walk away with: A toolbox of “state shifters” that help you stay tuned to abundance no matter what’s happening externally.
🌀 7. Operate from Flow, Not Force
Learn to trust, surrender, and co-create.
Surrender isn’t about giving up. It’s about getting in sync.
In this part of the experience, you’ll explore how to hold clear intentions while releasing the need to control every outcome. Learn how to trust the divine timeline, interpret intuitive nudges, and follow soul guidance that leads you further than strategy ever could.
🔮 This is the sacred blend of Sonia Choquette’s intuition-based creation, Vishen’s “bend reality” method, and the Mystic archetype’s gift of surrender.
You’ll walk away with: The ability to feel anchored and guided—even when you don’t know the full plan.
🌙 8. Integrate & Sustain Your Shift
Because real transformation isn’t just peak moments—it’s new baselines.
Most people experience transformation… and then slowly slip back.
This part of the training helps you hold the frequency of the new you. Through daily energetic practices, nervous system regulation, boundary upgrades, and habit design, you’ll learn how to protect your expansion and keep growing into it.
🌳 A must for Phoenixes and Guardians—those who rise fast but need grounding to stay there.
You’ll walk away with: Long-term practices to help you lock in the shift and make your new identity your lived reality.
This Is The Most Transformational Manifesting Summit Ever
If last year was powerful, this year? It’s a dimensional leap.
For the first time ever, we’re welcoming Dr. Joe Dispenza to the Mindvalley stage — leading sessions on brain-heart coherence, neuroplasticity, and quantum manifestation.
Joe’s work has impacted me in profound ways. His meditations? Helped me rewire core wounds. His research? Gave language to things mystics have whispered for centuries.
He’ll be joined by some of the most aligned, authentic manifesting masters I know: David Ghiyam, Roxie Nafousi, Regan Hillyer, Sonia Choquette, and Lee Holden., 
And of course, I’ll be there too — guiding you through deep inner rewiring, vision coding, and flow-state embodiment

Final Word: You Were Meant to Create
Here’s what I believe — not as a teacher, but as a fellow soul walking this wild Earth journey:
You’re not here to settle.
 You’re not here to hustle your worth.
 You’re here to create a life so aligned, so vibrant, that it reflects your deepest truth.
But you can’t build that life with broken tools.
 You need a new framework — one that understands identity, energy, and intention as the building blocks of your reality.
That’s what the Manifesting Summit is for.
If you’re ready to collapse time, drop the struggle, and finally feel in sync with your dream life…
This is your invitation.

 — Vishen
