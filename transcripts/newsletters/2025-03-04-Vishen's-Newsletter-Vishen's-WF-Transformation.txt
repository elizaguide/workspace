Subject: How I Lost Fat, Gained Energy, and Reversed Aging—Without Exercise
Preheader:
Losing weight isn’t about willpower or exercise—it’s about rewiring your relationship with food. And today, I have incredible news: WildFit is now included for free in Mindvalley Membership.
A Big Announcement for the Mindvalley Community


Every year, we improve and expand Mindvalley Membership to make it the most valuable personal transformation platform on the planet.
And today, I’m excited to share one of the biggest health upgrades we’ve ever made.
WildFit—our premium $800 health and nutrition program—is now included free in Mindvalley Membership.
If you’re a Mindvalley Member, you now have access to a program that has already transformed over 100,000 lives—including mine.
If you’ve struggled with weight, cravings, low energy, brain fog, or aging faster than you’d like—this is the program that can help you reset your body and health.
If you haven’t heard of WildFit before, let me share why this program changed everything for me.
The Moment I Knew Something Had to Change
It was January 2016, and I had just turned 40.
That morning, I looked at myself in the mirror.
And I wasn’t happy with what I saw.
22% body fat. My waistline had expanded and despite working out two to three times a week, my body wasn’t where I wanted it to be.
I had a sugar addiction. Every afternoon at 5 p.m., I would reach into my desk drawer for a Mars bar just to get a sugar spike to push me through the day.
I was aging faster than I wanted to admit. My hair was graying, and I was even noticing a bald spot forming.
Despite being someone who optimized every part of my life, my body wouldn’t cooperate.
I followed what I thought was a healthy diet:
- Cereal or a fruit shake for breakfast
- Two Starbucks lattes throughout the day
- Lunch of meat, chicken, or rice
- A home-cooked dinner—usually Indian, Thai, or Western cuisine
I wasn’t overeating, yet I felt sluggish, low on energy, and constantly in need of caffeine or sugar to function.
That’s when I met Eric Edmeades.
The Unexpected Meeting That Changed Everything

A few weeks later, I attended a Transformational Leadership Council event, a private gathering of some of the world’s top coaches, authors, and personal growth leaders.
That’s when I saw Eric Edmeades being called on stage to receive an award.
He wasn’t a doctor. He wasn’t a fitness trainer.
But he had transformed the health of dozens of people in that very room.
Naturally, I was intrigued.
I went up to him and asked, “Eric, what exactly do you do?”
And he said something that completely changed how I thought about health:
“Vishen, 85% of weight loss has nothing to do with exercise. It’s all about food.”
At first, I didn’t believe him.
We’ve been told for years that weight loss comes from exercise, discipline, and willpower.
But Eric wasn’t just making claims. He had spent years studying indigenous tribes, like the Hadza Bushmen in Africa—one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer societies.
These people never counted calories. They never went to the gym. They didn’t follow diets.
Yet they were lean, strong, and full of energy.
Eric realized that modern humans are trapped in a broken system—one that makes us crave unhealthy foods, get addicted to sugar, and feel guilty when we don’t have the willpower to “eat better.”

Worse - the modern media machine then tells us that the way to lose weight is through exercise. This is why so many food companies like Nestle and Coca Cola sell disgustingly unhealthy products but then sponsor sporting events. The idea is to shift the blame from ‘bad foods’ to ‘you’re not exercising enough.”
This is where Eric’s work comes in. 
He created WildFit as a way to reset the body’s natural relationship with food.
I decided to give it a try.
The 90-Day Transformation That Shocked Me
I started WildFit in February 2016.
Within 90 days, everything changed.
- My body fat dropped from 22% to 15%—without increasing exercise.
- My energy levels skyrocketed—I felt like I was in my 20s again.
- My mental clarity improved—flow states became effortless.
- My sugar cravings disappeared—I no longer needed my afternoon Mars bar.
- My hair stopped graying—even my bald spot started filling in.
And the most surprising part?
It wasn’t hard.
I didn’t count calories. I didn’t struggle with willpower. I didn’t force myself to exercise more.
WildFit wasn’t a diet. It was a complete reprogramming of how I thought about food.

With some vulnerability I’d like to share my before and after pics taken during and after the Wildfit program. 

The first pic is during week 5 of Wildfit (before the weight loss kicks in). 22% bodyfat. 
The second pic is after I finished the program. Now at 14% bodyfat. Excellent for a man over 40.
The final pic is what happened post-Wildfit when I started doing the 10X program on Mindvalley to gain more muscle. 

How WildFit Transformed My Family & Team
After seeing my results, I had to share WildFit with my family.
So I put both my mom and dad on WildFit.
- My mom lost 5kg (12 lbs) and looked healthier than she had in years.
- My dad’s energy surged—he could climb stairs effortlessly again.
One day, he told me, “To hell with what the doctor said. I’m going to live to see my grandkids grow up.”

That’s when I realized that WildFit isn’t just about weight loss—it’s about longevity.
I then introduced WildFit to my Mindvalley team, and here’s what happened:
- One designer lost 90 lbs in 6 months. 
- Two programmers set a record in our tech team for both losing 51 lbs in 3 months.
- Several people reported better skin, hair and even mental clarity. 
So in August of 2018, we decided to bring WildFit to Mindvalley. The initial program was $1500 when it first launched for the 3 month transformation.
And in the last seven years, it has transformed over 100,000 lives.

Why WildFit Works When Every Other Diet Fails
Most diets rely on:
Restriction & willpower (which only makes you crave the foods you’re avoiding) Intense exercise (which isn’t necessary for weight loss)
Short-term results (where you lose weight, but gain it all back)
WildFit is different.
It’s built on Behavioral Change Dynamics—a powerful framework that helps you rewire how you think about food.
Here’s what makes it unique:
No calorie counting (because restriction creates cravings)
No exercise required (movement is encouraged, but weight loss comes from food)
No hunger (if you’re hungry, you’re doing it wrong!)
Behavioral change techniques (so you no longer want unhealthy foods)
The “Seasons” model (teaching your body when & how to eat for optimal health)
That’s why WildFit has a 97% completion rate—one of the highest of any health program in the world.

The WildFit program is packed with eye-opening insights about food, nutrition, and how our bodies are designed to eat. 
Here are some stunning facts from the program:
1. Sugar is More Addictive Than Cocaine
📌 (Lesson 6: Understanding Cravings)
Studies show that sugar triggers dopamine release in the brain, making it more addictive than some drugs. Many processed foods are designed to keep us hooked. Why do you think sugar is in 70% of the typical American grocery store products? It gets you to BUY more. 
2. Humans Are the Only Species That Eat Against Their Instincts
📌 (Lesson 3: The Six Human Hungers)
Unlike animals, humans eat based on emotions, habits, and marketing—often ignoring true nutritional needs. Understand how emotions are tied to your cravings and you end the cravings. Example - ice cream and chocolate are seen as comfort food by many because these foods were given to us as children to make us calm down or feel better. 
3. The "Balanced Diet" Myth Was Created by Food Companies
📌 (Lesson 8: The Food Industry’s Influence)
The food pyramid was heavily influenced by corporate interests, promoting grains and dairy over fresh, whole foods. 
4. Seasonal Eating is Hardwired into Our DNA
📌 (Lesson 10: The Power of Spring, Summer, and Fall Foods)
Our ancestors naturally ate different foods in different seasons. WildFit teaches how mimicking this cycle can help with fat loss, energy, and long-term health.
5. Fat Isn’t the Enemy—Sugar Is
📌 (Lesson 12: Fats vs. Carbs in the Body)
For years, fat was demonized, but it's actually crucial for brain function, hormones, and energy. The real culprit behind obesity and chronic disease? Processed carbs and sugar.
6. Food Cravings Are Often Nutrient Deficiencies in Disguise
📌 (Lesson 7: The True Meaning of Hunger)
Cravings for chocolate? It might be a magnesium deficiency. Craving salty chips? Your body could be needing minerals, not junk food.
7. Dairy is Not as Essential as We Were Told
📌 (Lesson 14: The Dairy Deception)
Most humans are lactose intolerant to some degree. Milk is designed for baby cows, not humans—yet it's marketed as a "must-have" for strong bones.
8. Your Body Can Switch to Burning Fat Instead of Sugar
📌 (Lesson 16: Entering the WildFit Spring Phase)
The body naturally runs better on fat than on sugar. By reducing sugar intake and eating real foods, you can train your body to burn fat efficiently.
Want to go deeper? WildFit helps you reset your relationship with food and reclaim your natural instincts. 🚀🍏
