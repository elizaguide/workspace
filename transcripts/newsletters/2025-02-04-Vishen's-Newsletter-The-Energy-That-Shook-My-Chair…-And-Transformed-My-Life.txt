Subject : The Mysterious Energy Surge That Changed Everything

The Energy That Shook My Chair… And Transformed My Life
This email covers two things—both of which might tickle your mind. 
The first is about something called Kundalini energy. A surge of energy that many people report as a feeling of being shotshoot up their spine. 

And why does it seem to be happening to more and more people right now?
The second?
How we actually discover talent at Mindvalley.
Because here’s the thing—our biggest teachers weren’t always teachers.
In fact, people like Marisa Peer, Jeffrey Allen, Regan Hillyer, and Niraj Naik weren’t bestselling authors or famous speakers when we found them.
We found all of them sitting in the audience at a Mindvalley event.
So if you’ve ever dreamed of becoming a Mindvalley teacher, this story is going to surprise you.
And strangely enough—both stories are deeply connected.
So grab a cup of tea, settle in, and get ready—this is going to be a long email.
But I promise, by the time you’re done reading, you’ll look at manifestation, intuition, and your own potential in a completely new way.

The Experiment That Changed My Reality
Let’s rewind to 2015.
Dave Asprey, the legendary biohacker, founder of Bulletproof Coffee, and creator of 40 Years of Zen, invited me to participate in a cutting-edge experiment at his brain training facility in Seattle.
The goal?
To figure out how to give an ordinary person a monk’s brain.
Dave and his team had studied the neurological patterns of monks and found two fascinating things:
✅ High Alpha Amplitude – Monks have elevated alpha brainwavesbrainwaves, linked to deep relaxation and peak creativity.

✅ Left-Right Brain Coherence – Their brain hemispheres are in complete synchronization.
So the theory was simple:
If we could replicate these patterns using advanced biofeedback, we could literally rewire someone’s brain to function like a monk’s brain—without requiring decades of meditation.
This is what brought me to Seattle to participate in several sessions at Dave’s Mind Training Institute 40 Years of Zen. 

And there I was—sitting in a dark chamberchamber, with twelve electrodes attached to my head, staring at a screen that displayed my brain waves in real timereal-time.

For five days, I trained my brain to manipulate these visual and audio cuescues, while practicing specific exercises—forgiveness, compassion, andcompassion, appreciation.	
And then…
Something really strange happened.
💥 My chair started shaking violently.
At first, I thought one of the scientists was behind me, messing around.
Why the hell would someone shake my chair in the middle of my meditation?
I opened my eyes andeyes, turned around—but there was no one there.
And yet, I could feel something.
A surge of energy movedmoving up my spine, vibrating through my entire body. It wasn’t my chair shaking—itshaking - it was my entire upper body. 
I closed my eyes again—and suddenly, I was flung into a swirling red vortex in my mind. 
It felt like I had been pulled into another dimension.
ThenThen, I heard a powerful, firm, deeply reassuring voice.
It told me:
👉 You are safe.
👉 You are on the right path.
👉 Keep going.

In a semi-lucid state, this voice spoke to me in a firm, commanding way, telling me to stay focused on my vision for Mindvalley. Where I had doubts, it eased them. And where I needed clarity, itclarity - it told me to stick to my path. 
And then—it taught me something.
A technique.
But not just any technique—something that completely flipped my understanding of manifestation on its head.
For years, I had taught creative visualization—the idea that to manifest something, you need to picture it vividly in your mind.
But this voice told me:
You don’t need to visualize what you want.
You simply need to become the energy of what you want.
It called this technique Merging.
And it was so powerful that I later included it in Be Extraordinary, my signature Mindvalley program. (You will find the Merging technique for manifesting in the final week of the Be Extraordinary Program on Mindvalley Membership)
Now, I walked out of that session completely shaken (literally and metaphorically). 
I described the violent shaking to the scientists.
And they looked at me, slightly puzzled.
"That sounds like a Kundalini awakening," one of them said.
I dismissed it.
Kundalini? Some weird spiritual concept?
I figured I’d Google it someday and movemoved on with my life.
Or so I thought.

Then, Something Even Crazier Happened…
Fast forward to September 18, 2017. It’s now 4 weeks after my so-calledso called kundalini awakening. 
I was sitting in my studystudy, working on my computer, when a strong, unshakable intuition hit me.
🔹 Check your book rankings on Amazon.
I resisted.
My first book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, had been a mild success—it peaked at #4 on the New York Times list, then dropped off the list. I had put in so much work into the book,book but after years of writing just wanted to rest, recover,recover and not think about that book again. 
Why would I want to check its rankings on Amazon?
I didn’t feel like seeing my book slowly disappeardisappearing into the abyss of forgotten titles.
But the thought kept pushing itself into my mind.
🔹 Check your book on Amazon.
🔹 Check your book on Amazon.
So I gave in.
I logged into Amazon Author Central and froze.
I assumed Amazon was broken.
Because it showed me that I was the #2 author in the entire world.
Somehow, my book had overtaken:
✅ Hillary Clinton (whose book had just launched)
✅ The combined works of J.R.R. Tolkien
✅ The entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling
Here’s an actual screenshot from Amazon on that day. 

So I nowknow went to check my book’s rankings. My book was the #2 book in the world. No, not in a specific category. In ALL CATEGORIES. 

And the day before?
📢 I had been #1.

Another screenshot to show this:


🚨 WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. HECK?! 🚨
The Code of the Extraordinary Mind became the #1 Book in the entire world for 5 Days in 2017. 

(You can get it from Amazon here if you’d like to check it out)


Now I’d like to gift you a Kundalini Experience

So Kundalini experiences occur to people when they are in altered states. It happens to some during meditation, sometimes during sex, and also often during plant medicine or neuro-training experiencesexperienced (like my experience at 40 Years of Zen).

But you can also experience it via a great facilitator. 



The woman in the picture above is Dawn Hoang. She has the unique ability to channel energy and ‘beam’ it across a room and cause the people in that room to sometimes experience spontaneous Kundalini awakenings. 

Here’s her story

Kundalini Awakenings, Orgasmic Moaning, and Mindvalley’s Next Big Star
Dawn’s story begins at Mindvalley University,University where thousands of Mindvalley enthusiasts come together for two weeks to experience hundreds of talks, workshops, and transformational sessions. This year it'sits happening in Amsterdam on Aug 4 to 18. 

It’s unlike any event on the planet.
And here’s something most people don’t know:
Mindvalley University isn’t just about bringing world-class speakers and trainers.
It’s also about discovering new talent.
Here’s how it works:
👉 Over two weeks, we feature 100 speakers and presenters.
👉 50 of them are our established Mindvalley trainers—among the best in the world.
👉 But the other 50 spots?
They’re open to our community members.
That means anyone—from spiritual teachers to AI researchers to biohackers—can apply for a chance to take the stage.
Getting selected isn’t easy.
Every year, 400–500 people apply for just 50 spots.
But those who make it?
They often go on to become the next big names in personal growth.
That’s exactly what happened to Dawn Hoang.

Dawn Hoang’s Journey—From Audience Member to Mindvalley Star
Dawn had been a longtime Mindvalley fan.
She was there at our very first event in 2010—as a volunteer.
She watched Mindvalley grow.
She attended our events.
And in 2023, she decided to take a leap of faith.
She applied to speak at Mindvalley University.
Her topic? Kundalini Awakening.
If you’ve never heard of Kundalini, let me explain what makes it so unique.

The Experience That Left People in Tears… and Dancing
Dawn was selected to lead two sessions on Kundalini Activation.
And what happened next was wild.
Here’s what a Dawn Hoang Kundalini Awakening session looks like:
🔹 Dawn stands in the center of a room.
🔹 She taps into an energy field.
🔹 That energy is transmitted to every participant in the room.
Sounds strange, right?
But the effects on people are undeniable.
Imagine this:
✅ Some people enter a deep state of relaxation—almost like being in a trance.
✅ Others begin shedding tears as old emotional wounds heal before their eyes.
✅ Some feel energy moving through their bodies—like a wave of electricity.
✅ And some?


Some stand up and start dancing—completely lost in the energy, moving as if something is guiding them.
Now, here’s where things get really interesting.
A handful of participants start making orgasmic moaning sounds. The kundalini energy, after all, starts at the sacral chakra. 
Tears, dancing, moaning—all happening at the same time.
And yet…
Every single person who experienced it came out transformed.
Even those who felt nothing reported a deep sense of peace, clarity, and renewal.

What Happened Next Was Mind-Blowing
After Dawn’s first Kundalini Awakening session, something wonderful happened.
The session rating came in.
Perfect 5.0.
That rarely happens.
So naturally, by the time her second session came around…
It was completely flooded.
People were jumping past security barricades just to get inside.
Dawn asked us for more speaking slots—but we were completely booked.
So she did something truly kind…
On her own dime, she rented a local yoga studio and offered free Kundalini Awakening sessions to anyone who wanted one.
By the end of Mindvalley University…
She had guided 700 people through Kundalini Activation.
For free.
Why?
Because at Mindvalley University, we follow the principles of Burning Man.
That means if you speak or facilitate, you don’t charge.
It’s a gifting economy.
And Dawn embraced that completely.
At the end of the event, we reviewed our 50 community speakers to find the breakout stars.
Dawn’s name came out on top.
So at the Mindvalley Awards Gala in Dubai, she was honored with the Community Star Award.
And to present it to her?
None other than Grammy Award-winning artist Eve—famous for Who’s That Girl?

Mindvalley’s Secret to Finding Hidden Talent
Dawn isn’t the only talent we found in our community.
When I looked at the top 8 programs on Mindvalley this year, I realized something shocking:
💡 Half of them came from people we discovered in our audience.
People like:
✔️ Marisa Peer (discovered in Mexico, 2015)
✔️ Jeffrey Allen (discovered in Thailand, 2014)
✔️ Regan Hillyer (discovered in Croatia, 2017)
✔️ Niraj Naik (discovered in Croatia, 2017)
Think about that.
The next Mindvalley superstar is already in our community.
Maybe the next big transformational teacher isn’t some best-selling author or someone who’s been on Oprah.
Maybe…
It’s you.
And I can’t wait to discover you.
