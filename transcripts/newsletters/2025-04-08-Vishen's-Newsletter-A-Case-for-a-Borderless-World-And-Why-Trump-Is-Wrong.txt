A Case for a Borderless World (And Why Walls Are the Real Threat to Humanity)

Let’s get this out of the way: Borders are BS.
They’re imaginary lines drawn by dead men in wigs and kept alive by people in fear. They exist on maps but not in the hearts of the evolved.
And yet, we worship them like holy commandments. We let them define who gets access to safety, love, wealth, healthcare, and freedom.
Let’s break the spell.
A borderless world isn’t just a utopian ideal whispered by John Lennon and the Federation in Star Trek—it’s a data-backed, spiritually aligned, economically smart direction for humanity.
And yes… It’s the opposite of what Trump is trying to do to the world.
I started reflecting on this post today while at Singularity University in Silicon Valley, attending a dinner with fellow execs and tackling a very unique dinner table conversation.
On our table was a conversation starter card that made the nerd in me light up:
What can business leaders learn from the original Star Trek series?

My response to the question? 

Let’s slowly dismantle borders. Bit by bit. 

Let me explain. 

Why Do We Believe in Borders?
Ready for an entertaining ride on why we might want to reconsider how we tie our identities (and our mental models of how we understand others) to these imaginary lines? Buckle up.
In my book The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, I use a term called brules (short for bullsh*t rules) to describe useless laws and rules we humans still cling to in simplistic attempts to make sense of a complex world. The idea of borders is one of the biggest brules out there.
We worry about immigrants flooding into our civilized countries and raising crime rates.
We fear that refugees will leech off public funds and allow their exotic but alien cultures to taint our pristine way of life.
We worry that our ways will be replaced by people with a different skin color or who worship God based on a different ancient text.
In short: we fear.
But is this fear irrational?
Turns out, in a study of how much we truly understand the world—conducted by Swedish social scientist Hans Rosling—we’re basically clueless.
We have what’s called a negative bias toward the world. And these three facts show just how wide the gap is between reality and perception.
So I want you to do this quiz with me. Real quick. Answer these three questions:
1. What percentage of the world lives in poverty today?
2. What percentage of the world population now lives in a country other than their country of birth?
3. What’s the birth rate per woman outside the Western world?
Got your answers down? Okay, now let’s check your score.
Three Beliefs That Fuel the Fear of “A Borderless World”
1. The Myth of Global Poverty
In a 2018 study asking 32,000 people from 26 countries whether world poverty had increased or decreased over the prior 20 years—only 2% got it right.
The truth? Global poverty dropped from 40% in 1980 to under 9% today.
We’re living through the greatest poverty reduction in human history—and hardly anyone knows.
I was sitting in an Uber in Tallinn just a few months ago when the driver asked, “You’re of Indian origin, correct?”
I said, “Yes.”
He then proceeded to say, “Indian. Such friendly people. Pity your country is so poor. People suffer so much. Ah, the poverty. Very bad. Very bad.”
What my European Uber driver failed to understand was this:
Poverty rates in India have fallen so sharply that today only 2% of Indian households live on under $2/day—the global measure for extreme poverty.
Poverty is falling globally. But if Westerners think the world is swarming with starving, poor, decrepit souls seeking better chances… you’re going to shut your borders tight.

2. The Myth of Migration
According to Rosling’s data in Factfulness, only 3.4% of the global population lives outside the country they were born in.
That means 96.6% of humanity stays put. Most people want to stay home—they just want the opportunity to thrive while doing so.
Contrary to popular belief, millions of people aren’t trying to sneak into your rich country. They’re busy making life better and better in their own. 
India, China, the Middle East —all are experiencing tremendous bursts in quality of life and GDP. And fewer and fewer of them care about the “American Dream”. 

3. The Myth of “Baby Machines”
It’s common in the West to assume that people in India and the Muslim world have truckloads of kids. And if you let “those people” into your country—oh no! Prepare to be replaced.
Turns out this is far from true.
Today, the global average fertility rate is 2.1—exactly at replacement level.
And shockingly this includes countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.
Let me repeat that: Westerners and non-Westerners are both barely having children… at replacement level.
The exception? 9% still living in extreme poverty. When your child has a high chance of dying before age 5, you procreate more.
So why are Westerners so wrong?
Simple: right-wing politics in the US and Europe thrive on fear. 
The most useful fear? The fear of the other.
Western media is designed to make its citizens fearful, insular, and… let’s be honest—proudly ignorant.
Let’s rewind…
The American Border Crisis Was Manufactured
Hear me out for a moment…
The U.S.-Mexico border is one of the most emotionally charged political issues in America today. But what if the "crisis" dominating headlines was, in fact, a problem created by the very people who claim to be solving it?
Back in the 1980s, America didn’t have a border wall—and didn’t need one. 
Mexicans would cross over, work as day laborers, and then return home.
There was even a term for it: rotating door migration.
During the 1980 Republican presidential primary debate in Houston, Texas, on April 23, 1980, candidates Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush engaged in a surprisingly humane exchange about immigration—particularly concerning undocumented immigrants. Both emphasized compassion and practicality.
George H.W. Bush said:
“These are good people, strong people. Part of my family is Mexican.”
Ronald Reagan added:
“Rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit?”
Imagine that. Reagan, patron saint of modern conservatism, advocating for migrant workers—not demonizing them.
He didn’t see immigrants as threats. He saw them as neighbors.
He believed in circular migration—that workers could come to the U.S. temporarily, contribute, and return home without being criminalized. No walls. No mass deportations. Just legal, respectful cooperation.
But something changed.
🧱 What Changed? The Politics of 'Control'
By the mid-1980s, immigration had become a political lightning rod. The economy was under strain. Unemployment was up. And the media narrative started shifting from “hardworking migrants” to “illegal invaders.”
Even though Reagan held personal compassion, he faced growing pressure from within his own party to “restore control.”
So in 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)—a sweeping law that did two things:
- Legalized about 3 million undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.
- Criminalized hiring undocumented workers and increased border enforcement.
Reagan called it a “humanitarian” measure. And in many ways, it was.
But it came with a price.
🔁 The Unintended Consequence: From Circular to Permanent Migration
Before IRCA, Mexican workers would come seasonally—they’d work for months, then return to Mexico. It was a rotating door.
But after IRCA’s enforcement kicked in—especially employer sanctions and increased militarization of the border—crossing became riskier, costlier, and far more dangerous.
So what happened?
Migrants stopped going back. They brought their families and settled permanently.
The very enforcement meant to “control” immigration actually cemented it.
Sociologist Douglas Massey put it best:
“We transformed a circular flow of male workers into a settled population of families.”
So Reagan’s legacy is complicated.
He wanted openness and dignity. But in trying to appease both sides, he set in motion the very crisis the right wing would later weaponize.
Fast forward 30 years.
The GOP has gone from Reagan’s “Let’s work together with our neighbors” to Trump’s “Build the wall.”
From compassion… to cruelty.
From policy… to panic.
From work permits… to cages.
Reagan wasn’t perfect. But he never wanted a wall. He didn’t dream of bans and raids. He believed immigrants made America stronger.
What changed?
Fear won.
Fast forward to today:
Right-wing politicians have mastered this fear-based playbook.
Enter Trump. Enter JD Vance. Enter tariffs, bans, walls, and panic.
All built on useful myths.
The Real Stats: Illegal Immigrants Are Not the Problem
Contrary to campaign soundbites:
- Illegal immigrants do not commit more crime.
- They’re not causing rape waves.
- And most of those horror stories? Fabricated. Recycled political fiction.
Now, here’s a dose of reality:
Each year, undocumented immigrants in the U.S. contribute over $10,000 in taxes per household, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. That’s more than some citizens pay—and they do it while being ineligible for most public benefits.
They pay income taxes, property taxes (through rent), sales taxes, and Social Security—even though they’ll likely never see a dime of it in return.
So again—who’s really freeloading?
Americans are good, kind people. They get this. Even many who voted for Trump—when presented with the realities undocumented families face—respond with empathy. In fact, when asked about what should happen to undocumented immigrants already in the U.S., 70% of Americans said they preferred a pathway to citizenship over deportation. But at political action rallies? We see the dark side. (Some politicians bring out the worst in us.)
We’ve built a mythos around the “drain on the system” when, in fact, they are helping keep the system afloat—from farming to food service, from childcare to construction.
And let’s be honest: if you live in the U.S. and enjoy affordable strawberries in winter, a clean hotel room, or a well-maintained garden, you’re already benefiting from undocumented labor.


The Fear Machine Reloaded: Trump’s Tariffs and Global Poverty
And now, fear takes another form: economic warfare dressed up as patriotism.
Trump’s tariffs weren’t a strategy. They were a tantrum—one that tanked the stock market, raised consumer prices, disrupted global supply chains, and risked plunging the world into disconnection and poverty.
Why?
Because American voters fell for it. (Again. Sigh.)
These weren’t smart, tactical moves to protect American jobs. They were emotionally charged, fear-fueled maneuvers designed to punish an imaginary enemy called “everyone else.”
The result? Tariffs that cost the average U.S. household $400–$500 a year in added expenses. Billions in lost business. And a breakdown in trust with global trading partners.
Borders—which were being gently dissolved by global trade and digital collaboration—are rearing their ugly heads again.
And it’s hurting everyone.
Which brings us to the trillion-dollar question—the one that could redefine the future of our species if we’re brave enough to answer it honestly…
What Happens If We Erase Borders?
According to economist Michael Clemens, global GDP could double.
That’s not a typo. Double.
Because when people are free to move to where their talents are most needed, productivity soars. Innovation spreads. Opportunity multiplies.
And some economists take it even further: some models estimate global GDP could grow by up to 147% if we opened borders worldwide.
That’s not just a bigger pie. That’s a whole new global bakery franchise.
Borders trap potential. 
They lock brilliant minds and strong hands in environments where their contributions are stunted. 
But when we unlock that movement—
We don’t just help migrants. We lift everyone.
It’s the closest thing humanity has to a cheat code for prosperity.
So, what’s stopping us?
Fear. Again. But we’ve already seen what fear costs.
Now imagine what courage could gain.


Star Trek: The Federation of Us
In Star Trek canon, Earth unifies in the year 2150—just 125 years from now. And soon after, it joins the United Federation of Planets.
No more nations. No more borders. Just one species, one mission: to boldly go where no one has gone before.
The Federation isn’t just science fiction.
It’s a map. A metaphor. A model.
At the heart of this galactic alliance lies a Vulcan philosophy: IDIC—Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.
The idea? That every culture, every perspective, and every being—no matter how strange or different—adds richness to the whole.
That diversity isn’t something to tolerate. It’s something to celebrate.
That’s not just fantasy—it’s the future we’re capable of creating.
In a way, the Starship Enterprise wasn’t just a ship. It was Earth, evolved. A planetary crew navigating the galaxy with wisdom, inclusion, and curiosity as their compass.
And maybe—just maybe—it’s a glimpse of who we’re meant to become.
Not someday. But soon.
Because the Federation already exists in pieces: in our shared values, our intercontinental friendships, and the billions of us who already see ourselves not just as citizens of nations but as humans of Earth.
And it’s already starting to happen. 
Schengen: The Real-World Federation
Want proof that borderless living isn’t just sci-fi? Look at the Schengen Zone in Europe.
Every single day, 3.5 million people cross internal EU borders without showing a passport. No barbed wire. No interrogations. No identity theater.
I once road-tripped with my kids from Belgium to the Netherlands to Luxembourg to Germany to France—all in the span of 8 days by car. Not a single checkpoint. Not a single customs agent. Even my European SIM card worked seamlessly across countries. Not even a roaming fee to annoy me.
This is what happens when countries collaborate instead of compete.
Now contrast that with post-Brexit Britain:
- British families now face long lines at EU airports.
- They need visas to work abroad.
- Their economy? Shrinking.
UK households are now losing £1,300 a year in income due to reduced trade and investment.
If the average Brit who voted for Brexit had known their holiday in Spain would come with longer queues and a lighter wallet… would they have still voted for it?
Probably not.
The entire thing was built on a lie.
A lie stoked by—yes, again—right-wing politicians who used the fear of “others” to harvest votes.
And now, it’s the everyday people paying the price.
Dubai: A Case for Openness
If there’s a real-world prototype of Star Trek’s United Federation of Planets, it’s Dubai.
The Emiratis make up only about 8% of the population. The rest? A swirling dance of humans from every continent—working, co-creating, and building a future together.
Crime? Lower than most major Western cities.
Cultural erosion? Nope. Emirati identity isn’t just intact—it’s celebrated, respected, and globally influential.
Economy? Absolutely booming.
Dubai consistently ranks among the top 10 safest cities in the world, beating out cities like London, Paris, and New York. So much for “diversity brings danger.”
While much of Europe is aging, shrinking, and clenching its borders like a scared fist, the UAE opened its doors—and opened its future.
This isn’t an anomaly. It’s a blueprint.
I’ve made Dubai my home, and more and more of my friends, co-workers, and many Mindvalley authors are now moving there. Openness simply works!
Darwin Was Right: Evolve or Die
In 1872, Charles Darwin wrote one of the most prescient paragraphs I’ve ever read in any book. In The Descent of Man, he wrote:
“As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation... Once this point is reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.”
Darwin didn’t just predict evolution.
He predicted the European Union.

He didn’t just see where we came from. 
He saw our future. 
He saw that empathy expands with civilization.
That artificial barriers—like borders—block our most evolved instinct: sympathy.
And what did the British people do with that legacy?
They voted for Brexit.
Yes, Charles Darwin—voted one of the greatest Britons of all time—was spiritually slapped in the face by a nation that let fear rewrite its future.
As Professor Scott Galloway put it:
“Brexit is the greatest act of national self-sabotage since America invaded Iraq.”

Side note: Trump’s tariffs may prove to be an even greater—and dumber—act of self-sabotage.
Why I Wrote This (And Why I Carry 5 Residencies)
As an entrepreneur who’s created jobs across four continents, let me give you a real-world example of how fear-driven bureaucracy plays out:
- It took me two days to get residency in the UAE.
- It took me 419 pages of documentation and months to get the same in the United States.
- It’s taken me nearly a year (and counting) to secure residency in London, just so I can be present for my daughter, who is enrolling in school there.
This isn’t about the immigration “process.” This is about paranoia disguised as policy.
These outdated systems were designed for a world that no longer exists—a world run on fear, not facts.
I’ve lived on multiple continents. I’ve created jobs in countries that won’t give me citizenship. I’ve contributed millions to economies where I still get treated like an outsider.
And I know I’m not alone. This is the daily reality for millions of people like me: global citizens trapped by 20th-century paperwork.
This isn’t about process—it’s about paranoia.
These bureaucracies are relics of a world run by fear, not facts.
The Earth Flag I Fly
That’s why the only flag I’ll ever truly fly is the Earth Flag.
Designed by Swedish artist Oskar Pernefeldt, it features seven interlocking white rings on a deep blue background—symbolizing the unity of continents and all life on Earth.

It’s an amazing idea worth following. I simply don’t believe in the idea of countries anymore. I love the USA, Estonia, Malaysia, the UAE – all the countries that I’ve called home. But I choose to see myself as a citizen of Earth first.

So… What Now?
Let’s recap:
- Borders are fiction.
- Fear is the author.
- And the future belongs to those who can imagine beyond the lines.
It’s time to:
✅ Stop letting fear choose your leaders.
✅ Demand policies rooted in facts, not fiction.
✅ Stop voting for anyone who says ‘tariffs,’ ‘border wall,’ or ‘migrant invasion.’ They don’t have a vision. They have a marketing plan.
✅ Choose Earth. Choose openness. Choose evolution.
Because the greatest wall we need to tear down… is the one in our minds.
And on the other side?
The next version of humanity.
One world. One people. No borders.
Only horizons.
