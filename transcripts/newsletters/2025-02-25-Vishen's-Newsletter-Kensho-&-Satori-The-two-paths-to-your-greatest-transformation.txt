The Zen Model of Growth: Do You Evolve Through Pain or Insight?
Hero banner:
Hi (name)
There’s a concept I came across years ago that completely changed how I think about personal growth. And trust me, after interviewing thousands of the world’s greatest thinkers, that’s saying something.
It comes from Zen Buddhism, and it suggests that from the moment we’re born until the day we die, there’s a force pushing us to grow.
Now, this force can be gentle—like the hand of a close friend on your back, guiding you through an open door. Or it can be violent—like the universe smacking you in the face with a two-by-four.
It all depends on one thing: How closely are you listening?
I first heard this idea from Michael Beckwith, the founder of the Agape International Spiritual Center and the creator of Mindvalley’s Life Visioning Mastery program. In one of our many conversations, he explained how we grow through two distinct experiences:
Kensho & Satori.
This idea is so powerful that once you understand it, you’ll never look at struggles, setbacks, or unexpected breakthroughs the same way again.
Let’s dive in.


The Universe Can Help You Grow in Two Ways
Imagine this:
You’re living your life, going through the motions, when suddenly—BAM!
You lose your job.
Your relationship crumbles.
Your health takes a hit.
Your business collapses.
That’s what Michael calls a Kensho moment—growth through pain.
Kensho moments are the wake-up calls we never asked for but desperately need. They’re the moments of heartbreak, loss, or failure that force us to evolve. They’re painful, but they lead to breakthroughs.
Then there’s Satori moments. These are the flashes of insight—the “aha!” moments—that shift our perception instantly. They come from deep meditation, personal growth experiences, or profound realizations.
For example:
- You attend a Mindvalley seminar, and in one session, your entire worldview changes.
- You read a book, and it unlocks a whole new level of understanding.
- You experience a deep, altered state—through breathwork, meditation, or even plant medicine—and suddenly, life makes sense in a way it never did before.



The Difference Between Kensho & Satori
- Kensho = Growth through pain (illness, heartbreak, financial struggle, failure)
- Satori = Growth through insight (meditation, learning, sudden realizations)
If you’re deeply engaged in your own personal growth, you’ll experience more Satori moments—and fewer Kensho moments.
But here’s the problem: Most people aren’t listening.
Most people live life on a hamster wheel, too busy, distracted, or stuck in routine to actively seek out growth. And when you don’t create space for Satori moments, the universe will push you in a different way—through Kensho.
Kensho: The Universe’s Tough Love
Kensho is a gradual process that often happens through the tribulations of life. A relationship breaks up, but you learn from it and your heart becomes more resilient. You lose a business, but you use the hard-earned wisdom to start your next one. You lose your job, but you learn who you are beyond your career. You suffer a health problem, but you discover personal reserves you didn’t know you had.
Kensho is the universe giving you tough love.
Most of the time, we don’t even realize it’s happening. Imagine the tectonic shifts of the continents—we can’t see them in real-time, but when we map them over centuries, we see that the entire world has changed.
That’s what Kensho is doing to you.
At the time, it feels like life is falling apart.
But looking back, you realize that these painful moments pushed you to challenge beliefs, systems, and habits that were holding you back in ways you hadn’t even realized. This is why people often talk about a “blessing in disguise” or the silver lining behind their struggles.
And here’s the crazy part: Kensho moments aren’t random.
Beckwith suggests that Kensho is actually our soul’s way of calling on us to grow.
Your soul already knows where you need to evolve. But if you’re not actively listening, it will force you to wake up through pain.

Satori: The Sudden Realization That Changes Everything
Now, Satori is the opposite.
Satori moments don’t come from pain. They come from awakening—from moments of pure insight, where everything suddenly makes sense.
These are the instant “aha” moments where you feel a shift in your consciousness.
They can happen:
- During a deep meditation or spiritual awakening
- While listening to a profound speech
- Through an altered state experience (like breathwork or plant medicine)
- When reading a book that completely shifts your perspective
- When you’re in nature, lost in a moment of deep contemplation
Satori moments feel like the universe whispering in your ear:
"Hey, you’re on the wrong path. Check out the view from this angle."
Once you’ve had a Satori moment, the things that once held you back no longer have power over you. It’s like your mind upgrades to a higher operating system—suddenly, things make sense in a way they never did before.
Imagine you’ve been struggling with a problem for years—and then one day, in an instant, you just get it.
That’s Satori.
Dr. Beckwith once shared with me this little wisdom-bomb during an interview:
Behind every problem, there’s a question trying to ask itself. Behind every question, there’s an answer trying to reveal itself. Behind every answer, there’s an action trying to take place. And behind every action, there’s a way of life trying to be born.
That new way of life trying to be born is your calling. And who knows how this calling might influence the world and those around you?
If you were to plot your personal growth on a graph, Kensho moments would look like temporary dips, followed by sharp increases as you integrate the lessons. But Satori moments? Those would be sudden bursts of growth—instant leaps forward.



My Kensho Moment: How Pain Led Me to Mindvalley
I’ve had plenty of Kensho moments in my life.
One of the biggest happened when I was young. I suffered from terrible skin problems—so bad that I was bullied in school. I had no confidence. I felt hopeless. My mom took me to dermatologist after dermatologist, but nothing worked.
Then, one day, I stumbled upon a book on my father’s bookshelf.
It was called The Silva Mind Control Method. (Side note: Growing up in the late 80s, I read a lot more than kids do today—because back then, there was no internet or cable TV.)
One sentence in the book caught my attention.
“The skin is the organ most susceptible to human mental programming.”
Jose Silva, the book’s author, shared a visualization technique called The Three Scenes Technique (which is now in Mindvalley, by the way). It was a simple mental exercise for healing.
I had suffered from bad skin for five years.
But after practicing Silva’s method for just five weeks—three times a day, for three minutes each—my skin completely healed.
To this day, I have great skin for a man my age.
That one painful Kensho moment led me down a path of deep curiosity about the human mind. It led me to become a Silva instructor. And eventually, it led to me creating Mindvalley.
This is how Kensho works. Pain forces you to grow. But if you embrace it, it can take you somewhere extraordinary.
Why I Now Embrace Every Challenge
I’ve learned this concept so deeply that now, whenever life throws me a Kensho moment, I don’t panic.
Even when things go horribly wrong, I know there’s a breakthrough on the other side.
Yes, I still allow myself to feel the pain. But instead of seeing it as an ending, I see it as a transition—a necessary push from the universe to level up.
This is why I live with the belief that every struggle is by design.
It’s not random. It’s not pointless.
It’s happening for me, not to me.
How to Shift from More Kensho to More Satori
Most people experience more Kensho than Satori. Why?
Because they’re not listening.
They live life on autopilot, repeating the same patterns, ignoring their intuition, and resisting change—until the universe forces them to wake up through painful experiences.
But here’s the good news: You can choose to shift from Kensho to Satori.
How?
1. Commit to a Daily Meditation Practice
Meditation creates space for Satori moments. It quiets the noise and allows you to hear the whispers of insight before life has to shout at you.
2. Engage in Continuous Learning
Attend personal growth events, take courses, read books, and actively seek wisdom. The more you expose yourself to new perspectives, the more likely you are to experience Satori.
3. Build Self-Reflection into Your Routine
Journaling, therapy, and self-inquiry help you process your life’s challenges before they become full-blown crises.
4. Set Aside 20 Minutes for Mindvalley Every Day
If you’re actively learning, evolving, and upgrading your mind, the universe doesn’t need to shake things up for you through Kensho moments.
Because if you’re listening, the universe doesn’t have to smack you in the back of the head to get your attention.
Your Exercise: Mapping Your Life’s Growth
I want you to try something powerful today. It’s called The Lifeline Exercise, and it will help you recognize how Kensho and Satori moments have shaped your life.
Here’s how it works:
1. Grab a journal.
2. Draw a simple graph with time on the X-axis and your quality of life on the Y-axis.
3. Think about the last 10-20 years of your life. Identify the major moments where your life dipped (Kensho) and where it leveled up (Satori).
4. Reflect on what you learned from those moments.
When I did this, I saw clear patterns.
Some of my lowest points led to my biggest breakthroughs. And when I embraced growth, my Kensho moments became less frequent, while my Satori moments skyrocketed.
Now, I want you to try it.
And if you feel like sharing, post your Lifeline in our Mindvalley community. You never know who your story might inspire.
