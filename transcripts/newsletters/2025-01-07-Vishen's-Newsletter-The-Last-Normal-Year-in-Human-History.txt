2025: The Last Normal Year in Human History
Dear Mindvalley Family,
Here we are in 2025. I hope the year is starting off beautifully for you. But as we step into this pivotal year, there’s an idea that’s been weighing on my mind. It’s a thought so profound that it has been keeping me awake at night.
And that idea is this: 2025 will be the last “normal” year in human history.
Now, I know that sounds dramatic, even audacious. But once you see where the world is headed, you’ll understand why this year is unlike any we’ve experienced before. Let me take you on a journey through time to set the stage for what’s unfolding.
A World Frozen in Time
Let’s go back to 3 BC, to one of history’s most legendary figures—Alexander the Great. If you’re a fan of history like I am, you’ll know Alexander was a conqueror who reshaped the world as he knew it. At just 20 years old, he led an army that expanded across three continents, spreading Greek culture and uniting vast empires.
Now imagine Alexander standing in awe before the Great Pyramids of Giza. These colossal monuments, timeless and imposing, must have seemed like a glimpse of eternity to him. But here’s the astonishing part: the pyramids were already ancient when Alexander saw them—2,300 years old, to be exact.

And yet, despite the grandeur of his conquests and the cultural flourishing of his time, Alexander lived in a world that barely changed over the centuries.
Closer to the iPhone Than to the Pyramids
Now let’s add a modern twist. Alexander the Great, who stood before the pyramids, was closer in time to the invention of the iPhone than to the construction of those pyramids.
Yes, you read that right.
The same Alexander who gazed at these ancient wonders existed closer to the launch of Apple’s iPhone in 2007 than to the day those pyramids were built. Let that sink in for a moment.
And yet, for most of human history, the world barely moved forward. If Alexander had leapt 1,000 years into the future to the 12th century, he might have marveled at the majestic cathedrals of Europe or the riches of the Islamic Golden Age. But daily life? It would have been startlingly familiar. People still plowed fields by hand. They still lit their homes with oil lamps. They still relied on horses and ships to get from place to place.
Even if Alexander had jumped ahead another 500 years to the Renaissance, the printing press and gunpowder would have caught his eye. But these advancements wouldn’t have felt magical—they would have seemed like logical extensions of what he already knew.
The Century Where Magic Became Real
Now imagine Alexander fast-forwarding to the 20th century. This is where everything changes. He’d see airplanes slicing through the sky, towering skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world today), and those magical glass rectangles we call smartphones.
He’d watch in disbelief as humans landed on the moon. He’d witness cars driving themselves and televisions bringing moving images into every home. And then there’s the internet—a network that connects every corner of the globe, allowing instant access to the sum of human knowledge.
To Alexander, these advancements wouldn’t have seemed like progress. They’d have seemed like magic.


Peter Diamandis and the Era of Exponential Progress
What happened? How did we go from a world frozen in time to one of unimaginable transformation?
In 2016, I had the privilege of sitting down with futurist Peter Diamandis, and he explained it to me in a way I’ll never forget:
“Vishen, think of all the progress humanity made between 1900 and 2000. The airplane, the moon landing, the transistor, the internet—all of it happened in a single century. Now here’s the crazy part: the same level of technological progress we achieved in those 100 years is now being compressed into a few decades.”
Peter went on:
“Between 2000 and 2016, we saw the rise of Facebook, YouTube, Tesla, and the iPhone. But the pace of change is accelerating. From 2016 to 2022, we saw just as much innovation. And between 2022 and 2026? The same amount of progress will happen again—100 years of progress - compressed into just four years.”
I remember sitting there, stunned. Could this really be true? But now, in 2025, I see exactly what Peter meant.
The AI Explosion: Why 2025 Is Different
Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gone from being a futuristic concept to something that’s transforming every corner of our lives. And here’s what’s truly mind-blowing: we’re just getting started.
It’s not every day that we get a glimpse into the minds of the people shaping our future. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence, recently shared a revelation that stopped me in my tracks. His words confirmed what many of us have suspected but struggled to fully comprehend: we are on the brink of something truly extraordinary.
Sam revealed that his team is now confident in their ability to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This is the moment we’ve all been anticipating—the point where AI isn’t just a tool but something that thinks, reasons, and adapts like a human. And that’s not all. They’re now setting their sights even higher.
Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) just said this:

“We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’ and materially change the output of companies. We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.”
Let that sink in for a moment. AGI—once a far-off dream—is now within reach. And even more astonishingly, we’re already thinking beyond AGI to superintelligence, a level of AI that could solve problems so complex they’re currently beyond human comprehension.
Imagine a world where diseases like cancer are eradicated, where scientific breakthroughs happen at a speed we can hardly fathom, and where abundance becomes the norm for humanity. This isn’t science fiction—it’s the future we’re stepping into. And 2025 is the year it begins.
What Is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)?
AGI refers to AI that can think, reason, and learn at a human level across any task. Unlike today’s AI, which is task-specific, AGI would adapt like a human—writing novels, solving problems, or understanding emotions with the same versatility as a person.
What Is Superintelligence?
Superintelligence goes beyond AGI, surpassing human intelligence in every way. It could solve problems no human could comprehend, innovate at unimaginable speeds, and optimize systems like healthcare and energy to create abundance for all.
The Key Difference:
- AGI matches human intelligence.
- Superintelligence exceeds it, unlocking unimaginable possibilities.
Both have the potential to redefine our world.
And we are moving towards this faster than you think…
By the end of 2025, we’ll see the rise of AI agents. These aren’t just chatbots that help you answer emails. These are autonomous systems capable of solving complex problems, managing entire projects, and functioning as if they were human employees.
But the revolution doesn’t stop there. The next frontier is embodied AI—physical robots equipped with advanced AI. Imagine humanoid machines performing surgeries, constructing buildings, or even helping care for the elderly.
Your average street in 2028 will likely look like the picture below. With robots mingling with humans. 


The Opportunities—and the Risks
This is the double-edged sword of progress.
On one hand, AI has the potential to create a world we can hardly imagine:
- A world where cancer is cured, and diseases like Alzheimer’s become history.
- A planet where climate change is reversed, and clean energy powers every home.
- A future where poverty is eradicated, and abundance becomes the norm.
But with great power comes great responsibility.
What happens if AI becomes too powerful? Could it develop goals that conflict with ours? These aren’t just science fiction scenarios—they’re challenges we must address today.
How to Thrive in 2025
Let’s get real for a moment. This is not a normal year. The world is moving faster than ever, and the changes coming our way will disrupt nearly every aspect of life—from the way we work to the way we age, and even the way we think about reality itself.
If you’re wondering how to navigate these seismic shifts, you’re not alone. I’ve been asking myself the same question, and I’ve identified three key areas where I’m focusing my energy this year. These aren’t just strategies—they’re imperatives.
Here’s what I’m doing, and what I believe can help you thrive in this extraordinary time:
1. Master AI Before It Masters You
Let’s start with the obvious: AI is taking over.
I’ve already seen this happening in my own organization. Employees who embrace AI are doubling their productivity. They’re automating mundane tasks, generating creative ideas faster, and achieving results that used to take days in mere hours.
These individuals—what I call “AI-enabled super-producers”—are becoming the MVPs of the workplace. And here’s the kicker: it’s not because they’re smarter or more talented. It’s because they’ve decided to partner with AI rather than fear it.
If you’re an employee, ask yourself this:
- Are you using AI tools like ChatGPT, MidJourney, or other platforms to amplify your output? 
- Are you staying curious, experimenting with new ways to integrate AI into your work?
- Are you positioning yourself as someone who can leverage technology to solve problems faster?
If the answer is no, now is the time to start.
For CEOs and Leaders:
If you’re leading a company, you need to rethink everything you thought you knew about hiring and team management. Why? Because AI agents are coming—and they’re about to change the rules of the game.
These aren’t just digital assistants that write emails or schedule meetings. AI agents will be capable of managing entire projects, solving complex problems, and even operating with the decision-making skills of a mid-level manager.
Imagine this:
- Instead of hiring 10 new employees, you deploy 5 AI agents that can handle 70% of the workload.
- Instead of spending months training a new hire, you onboard an AI agent in hours.
- Instead of relying on outdated processes, your organization evolves in real-time, driven by AI insights.
This is the future, and it’s happening faster than you think.
How I’m Applying This:
At Mindvalley, I’ve stopped hiring in the traditional sense. Instead, we’re focusing on upskilling our existing team to become AI-enabled super-producers. My belief is that the best teams of the future won’t just be composed of humans—they’ll be humans and AI working in perfect synergy.
If you want to thrive in 2025, start thinking about how you can integrate AI into every corner of your work. Whether you’re an individual contributor, a manager, or a business owner, AI isn’t just a tool—it’s your new partner in success.
2. Invest in Longevity
Let’s talk about your health.
With the rise of AI and breakthroughs in biotech, we’re entering an era where living to 100—or even 120—will be entirely possible. But here’s the question: do you want to live those extra decades thriving or just surviving?
For me, the answer is clear. I want to thrive. I want to wake up at 100 feeling energized, flexible, and mentally sharp. And if you’re alive today, you have a chance to achieve this too—but only if you start investing in your health now.
The Future of Longevity:
AI and superintelligence are already accelerating breakthroughs in medicine. Imagine a world where diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s are eradicated. Where stem cell treatments repair damaged organs. Where personalized medicine optimizes your body’s performance in ways we can’t yet fathom.
That future is closer than you think. And if you’re not paying attention to longevity science, you’re missing out on one of the greatest revolutions of our time.
What I’m Doing:
This year, I’m diving headfirst into advanced longevity protocols. Here are a few examples:
- Stem Cell Therapy: I’ll be working with Dr. Adil Khan in Dubai to repair a recurring back issue and enhance overall vitality.
- Muscle Optimization Protocols: I’m exploring treatments that amplify muscle growth, so every gym session delivers maximum results.
- Reversing Signs of Aging: Yes, I’m even experimenting with therapies that reduce gray hair and improve skin health. Why? Because feeling good about your appearance is part of thriving.
Now, I know some of these treatments might sound out of reach for most people. But you don’t need to start with cutting-edge science to invest in your health. The basics—regular exercise, clean eating, quality sleep—are the foundation of longevity.
Where to Start:
If you’re curious about how to begin your own longevity journey, I highly recommend Dave Asprey’s Smarter Not Harder Quest on Mindvalley. Dave, known as the father of biohacking, breaks down simple, practical strategies you can use to optimize your health today.
3. Master the Art of Manifesting
In a world of rapid change, the ability to manifest your goals and shape your reality isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s essential.
Now, before you roll your eyes, let me explain. Manifesting isn’t about wishful thinking or repeating affirmations in the mirror. It’s about taking control of your mind and using it as a tool to create the life you want.
What Manifesting Really Means:
- Clarity: Get crystal-clear on what you want to achieve in 2025. What’s your vision for your career, your health, your relationships? Write it down. Make it vivid.
- Resilience: The world is unpredictable. Manifesting requires building mental toughness, so you can stay focused even when life throws curveballs.
- Actionable Steps: Manifesting isn’t magic—it’s a system. Break your goals into tangible, actionable steps, and commit to them daily.
How It Works:
At Mindvalley, we’ve been teaching manifestation techniques for years, and I can tell you this: the results are real. From creating abundance to transforming relationships, the power of your mind is limitless—if you know how to harness it.
To dive deeper, join us at our Manifesting Mastery Event this month. Alongside incredible teachers like Reagan Hillier and Jeffrey Allen, I’ll be sharing tools to help you navigate this era of disruption with clarity and purpose.
Why These 3 Areas Matter
Here’s the bottom line: 2025 is a year of transformation. The rules are changing, and the opportunities are endless. But if you’re not prepared—if you don’t adapt—you risk being left behind.
By mastering AI, investing in your health, and sharpening your ability to manifest, you’re not just surviving this era of change—you’re thriving in it.
