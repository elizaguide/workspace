How to Improve Your Brain and Gain Focus

The Day My Brain Humbled Me
Let me take you back a couple of years. It was shortly after I recovered from COVID. I had just walked into Dr. Daniel Amen’s brain clinic in Southern California, feeling like a rockstar.
Why? Because I had proof I was in amazing health.
At 46, my biological age test came back as… drumroll, please… 20 years old! My Glycanage results were so good I half-expected Dr. Amen to scan my brain and say something like:
"Vishen, we’ve never seen a brain this exceptional. You’re like the Einstein of 2020s biohackers."
But what I got instead was a harsh dose of reality.
“Vishen,” Dr. Amen said, “your brain is aging faster than your body. You’ve got the brain of someone in their fifties.”
Hold on. What?
My jaw practically hit the floor. How could this be possible? My body was thriving! I was practicing HIIT, meditating, and following a solid diet.
But my brain? It was underperforming.
Dr. Amen explained a few potential causes. COVID was still wreaking havoc on my system, for one. But then he mentioned something else that stuck with me: “You might want to stop drinking alcohol.”
Now, let me confess something. I wasn’t exactly a heavy drinker—just four glasses of wine a week. But I couldn’t shake his words. Could even a little bit of alcohol be holding my brain back?
That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands.
The 4-Week Experiment That Changed My Life
When I got back to Europe, I decided to make some changes. I didn’t wait for Monday. I didn’t tell myself, “I’ll start next month.”
I went all in.
For the next four weeks, I cut out alcohol completely. No wine, no champagne, not even a celebratory toast at a dinner party.
I also revamped my diet. Inspired by the WildFit protocol, I stuck to a strict regimen of meat, veggies, and whole foods. No sugar. No processed snacks. Just pure, nourishing fuel for my body and brain.
I’ll be honest—it wasn’t easy. Those first few days were rough. I missed my evening glass of wine. I craved sweets after meals. But something magical happened around the one-week mark.
My focus started improving.
And I don’t mean a little. I mean dramatically.
- Tasks that used to take hours suddenly flew by.
- I felt sharp, alert, and present in every conversation.
- Creative ideas poured out of me like water from a tap.
By the end of the four weeks, I felt like a different person. My productivity was off the charts, my mind felt alive, and I realized something important: I’d only scratched the surface.
Six Months Later: A Brain Reborn
That four-week experiment turned into a six-month alcohol-free journey. No exceptions. And let me tell you—the transformation was nothing short of miraculous.
Not only was my focus at an all-time high, but I also noticed a ripple effect across every area of my life.
- I was more present with my family.
- My creativity surged to levels I hadn’t experienced in years.
- Tasks that once felt overwhelming became almost effortless.
At work, I reached new heights of productivity. What used to take me five days now took two and a half. That freed up time to launch new projects, like the Mindvalley States supplement line and the Future Human Festival in Dubai.
And it wasn’t just about cutting out alcohol. Along the way, I discovered a few other brain hacks that supercharged my focus and clarity—and I want to share them with you today.
3 Tools to Reclaim Your Focus and Brain Health
1. Reduce Your Baseline Stress
2. Stress is one of the sneakiest brain killers. It chips away at your focus, creativity, and mental resilience.
The good news? You can rewire your brain to naturally reduce stress. One of the most powerful tools I’ve found is Paul McKenna’s Everyday Bliss Hypnotherapy.
It’s a short audio session available on Mindvalley that rewires your brain to release stress and create a sense of calm. Paul recommends listening to it for seven consecutive days—and trust me, the results are mind-blowing.
I use it regularly to stay grounded, focused, and clear-headed, even during the most hectic weeks.
1. Upgrade Your Brain Chemistry
2. Let’s talk about supplements. I’m not a fan of pharmaceutical solutions that promise focus but come with side effects. Instead, I turned to natural compounds that enhance brain function.
Two standouts:
- Alpha GPC: Boosts cognition and memory.
- Paraxanthine (ParaZanthin): A cleaner caffeine alternative that delivers focus without the jitters.
I loved these so much I worked with my team to create the Mindvalley Focus Pill, combining these compounds with other brain-boosting ingredients. It’s like a shortcut to flow state—natural, effective, and sustainable.
1. Master Your Attention with Nir Eyal
2. Distractions are everywhere. Social media. Endless notifications. That email you “just have to check.”
Nir Eyal’s Becoming Focused and Indistractable Quest on Mindvalley helped me reclaim my attention and eliminate distractions. Nir is a former tech insider who once taught app developers how to make their platforms addictive. Now, he’s teaching people how to break free.
His methods are simple, practical, and incredibly effective for staying on track and doing your best work.
Why Your Brain Deserves More Love
We live in a world obsessed with aesthetics. People spend hours perfecting their abs, sculpting their biceps, and toning their glutes. But let me ask you this:
When was the last time you did something to strengthen your brain?
The truth is, your brain is your most valuable asset. It’s what drives your creativity, your productivity, and your ability to connect deeply with others. But because it’s invisible, we often take it for granted.
That was my mistake. I thought I could coast by without giving my brain the attention it deserved. But once I started prioritizing it, everything in my life improved.
Your Next Steps
If you’re ready to unlock your brain’s full potential, here’s where to start:
1. Try Paul McKenna’s Everyday Bliss Hypnotherapy for seven days straight.
2. Experiment with the Mindvalley Focus Pill to fuel your brain naturally.
3. Join Nir Eyal’s Becoming Focused and Indistractable Quest to master your attention and eliminate distractions.
Your brain is the gateway to your dreams. Treat it well, and it will reward you with focus, creativity, and limitless potential.
To your transformation,
Vishen
