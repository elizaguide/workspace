Subject: 3 Questions You Need To Answer To Grow Your Business
Preheader: At MVU Amsterdam, I asked our community these 3 questions. Now it’s your turn.

3 Questions You Need To Answer To Grow Your Business


At MVU Amsterdam, on stage, I asked the audience three simple questions about their journey as entrepreneurs 
And, the answers that came back were powerful.
I want to share the questions and some of the answers with you today. 
 
See if you relate.
Question 1: 📚 What’s the most important thing you need to learn to grow your business?
“Marketing / social media / sales.”
“How to differentiate myself.”
“Get over perfectionism and motivate myself to start doing instead of planning and perfecting” 
“Financial management.” 
“LEARN TO HIRE EFFECTIVELY” 
Question 2: 🚀 What’s stopping you from doubling your revenue?
“I don't follow an action plan. I get distracted.” 
“My fear to take risk quitting my job and bringing in danger my family” 
“I’m lacking the visibility and the operational systems. I also create an energetic barrier between myself and my wealth.”
The fear of letting go of the current practices - the ones that are NOT making money,  but are familiar. It's also the not-knowing of who to hire and when” 
“Time (as I am currently working a full-time job with 2 young kids).” 
Question 3: 👤 Who would you most like to learn from in business?
“Richard Branson because he joyfully innovates in multiple sectors. And because he is a community builder with a bigger vision of what he can help change in the world”
“Naval Ravikant — because he is practical and simple and makes so much sense.” 
“Oprah Winfrey.” 
“Vishen to integrate strategy and implementation”
“Steven Bartlett - learns so much insights from different successful people, knows how to talk about ideas”
When I read these answers, I realized: business owners aren’t just struggling with marketing hacks, funnels, or ad spend.
The deeper challenges are fear, overwhelm, lack of clarity, and self-doubt. 
And the biggest breakthroughs happen when you build the right mindset, community, and support around you.

This is What We’re Building Next
You see, we are looking at launching an Entrepreneurial Degree due to popular demand.
This degree is designed to train people on the art of scaling businesses from $5 million to $10 million and even $100 million in revenue.
As many of our Mindvalley teachers—and myself—have done.
And we’d love to get your feedback as we shape it.
Now It’s Your Turn
We are now opening up the same 3-question to you and our entire Mindvalley community today.
Because if you’re going to build a $100M business—one that lasts, one that uplifts, one that changes lives—you need more than tactics.
[Take 2 minutes to answer these questions]
Your voice will help us co-create something the world hasn’t seen before: an entrepreneurial path that scales both your business and your soul.
With love and vision,

 — Vishen
