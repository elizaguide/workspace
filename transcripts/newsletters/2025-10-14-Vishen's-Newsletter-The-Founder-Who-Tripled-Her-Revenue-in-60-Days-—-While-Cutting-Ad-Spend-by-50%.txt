Blog Sub: 5 Lessons that Could Make You Triple Your Business in 60 Days 

The Founder Who Tripled Her Revenue in 60 Days — While Cutting Ad Spend by 50%
A few days ago, I got a voice note that totally blew me away — but more than that, it lit me up.
It was from a Mindvalley University attendee, an entrepreneur who had listened to just four hours of talks by me and Daniel Priestley during Entrepreneurship Day in Amsterdam.
She told me she’d written down 10 different ideas from those sessions — but then she did something that most people don’t do.
She gave herself 60 days to implement them.
The result?
 👉 Her company’s revenue TRIPLED.
 👉 Her ad spend dropped by half.
 👉 And in a single week, she got more website traffic than the previous three months combined.
When I heard this, I was absolutely thrilled. 
Because this wasn’t a beginner entrepreneur just starting out.
This was Nora Cavani, a powerhouse who was voted Female Founder of the Year at Web Summit 2024 — one of Europe’s top honors for entrepreneurs.
This woman already knew her stuff.
 And yet, the insights she picked up at Mindvalley University still transformed her business in ways that surprised even her.
So, what exactly did Nora do?
I asked her to go deep — to walk me through everything she implemented — because I believe her story can add massive value to you, especially if you’re building or scaling a business right now.
This isn’t theory.
This is what happens when real founders take bold ideas and apply them with precision.
For some of you, what you’re about to read might just change the trajectory of your business.
Because if this framework can help the Female Founder of the Year in Europe tripled her business in 60 days…
Imagine what it can do for you.

First off, the learning from Nora happened during Mindvalley U’s Entrepreneurship day. I was the main speaker alongside Daniel Priestly who is the #1 guest on Stephen Bartlett’s Diary of a CEO podcast - one of the top podcasts in the world. 

And his mind is gorgeous. He’s scaled seven companies to $100M+ in revenue. He’s now the main teacher in our new Entrepreneurship Mastery Degree along with me. 



So what did Nora learn from Daniel and me? Here are the 5 big things (feel free to copy).

Lesson 1: Master the Power of Webinars
When I was on stage at Mindvalley University, I shared how I’ve sold over $400 million worth of products through webinars — and I revealed the exact principles behind why they work.
A great webinar isn’t about pitching.
 It’s about educating.
 When people learn something that changes how they see the world, they don’t need to be sold — they buy.
That’s what Nora understood.
Her company, Alba Health, helps parents identify and address gut microbiome imbalances in children — a new and fast-growing field in health.
 But here’s the challenge: when a parent first hears “We test your child’s poop to help them be healthier,” the natural reaction is… Wait, what?
That’s where the power of education comes in.
A well-designed webinar — usually around 60 to 90 minutes long — gives you time to take your audience on a journey:

 1️⃣ Start with the problem they didn’t know they had.
 2️⃣ Educate them with science, stories, and empathy.
 3️⃣ Then introduce your solution as the natural next step.
Nora built her webinar around this structure.
 She began by teaching parents something most of them had never been told before:
 that the balance of bacteria in a child’s gut can directly impact not just their digestion — but their immune system, emotional regulation, and even neurological development.
Once parents understood that, the idea of testing gut bacteria stopped sounding strange — and started sounding essential.
Only then did Nora introduce Alba Health’s Gut Microbiome Test for Kids and explain how it works: parents order a simple at-home test, send in a small sample, and receive a detailed personalized report about their child’s microbiome, with guidance on how to restore balance through nutrition and supplements.
The result? Parents didn’t feel they were being sold a product.
 They felt they were being empowered with knowledge.
That’s the secret of a powerful webinar.
 It shifts your role from “seller” to “teacher.”
 And when people trust you as a teacher, they’ll follow you as a customer.

Lesson 2: Never Ignore the Goldmine of Email Marketing
During my talk at Mindvalley University — and again at our recent Entrepreneurship Summit — I showed the audience a screenshot of the very first Mindvalley website.
It’s not pretty.
 In fact, it looked like something that escaped the early 2000s. Because it did.
I built it in 2003 using Microsoft FrontPage — and if you’ve never heard of that software, count yourself lucky.
But hidden inside that painfully old website was a tiny breakthrough that changed my business forever.
If you look at the image below, you’ll see a small box circled on the right-hand side.
 That little box didn’t sell a product.



 It offered something free: a nine-part email series — a short book I’d written called The Unlimited You.
Now here’s what made it work.
Instead of just trying to sell Mindvalley’s top product at the time — the Silva Ultramind Home Study Course — I decided to teach first.
Each email was a bite-sized lesson on meditation, creative visualization, altered states, and unlocking human potential.
 Every day for nine days, subscribers received one new lesson.
And at the end of each email, there was a simple line:
“P.S. If you enjoyed this lesson, we go deeper in the Silva Ultramind Home Study Course — and you can get $20 off here.”
That’s it.
 No hype. No pushy sales copy. Just consistent, valuable education.
When I first launched that campaign, I was terrified it would hurt sales.
 I thought, “If I give away all this free knowledge, who’s going to buy the actual course?”
But the opposite happened.
The free series exploded. It was downloaded over a million times, and our product sales went up 96% overnight.
That tiny autoresponder sequence became one of the foundations of Mindvalley’s early growth.
And it worked because it did one thing most entrepreneurs forget to do — it built trust before selling.
Nora applied the same strategy. 
It worked like magic.

Lesson 3: Offer Value Before You Sell
One of the most powerful ideas shared at Mindvalley University came from my friend and co-teacher Daniel Priestley.
He said something that completely reframed how many entrepreneurs in the room thought about sales:
“Don’t try to sell your product.
 Sometimes what you need to sell first is a free assessment that helps your customer discover why they need your product.”
That single insight hit Nora like a lightning bolt.
Up to that point, her company, Alba Health, had been selling its gut-microbiome test for kids directly from its homepage.
 Parents could buy the test — but they didn’t always understand why they needed it.
So Nora tried Daniel’s approach.
She redesigned her website and added a free assessment that allowed parents to answer a few simple questions about their child’s health, energy, mood, and diet.

 Within minutes, the quiz generated a personalized health insight and gently suggested the next step:  to confirm the results through Alba Health’s microbiome test.
No hard sell. No “Buy now” buttons flashing red.
 Just genuine curiosity and service.
And it worked.


Almost overnight, Nora began receiving hundreds of new leads every day.
 But more importantly, she started building a community — parents who felt seen, understood, and guided before being sold to.
That quiz didn’t just generate sales.
 It built trust.
 And trust, in business, is the rarest currency of all.
Takeaway:
 Serve first.
 Sell later.
 Trust always.
Lesson 4: Let AI Do the Heavy Lifting
One part of my presentation that really lit up the room — and Nora especially — was when I showed how Mindvalley now runs with AI employees.
Not assistants. Not tools. Actual AI employees.
Each one is designed for a specialized purpose —
 an AI for email marketing,
 an AI for copywriting,
 an AI for YouTube script direction,
 and even AIs that analyze performance data and make creative recommendations.
These aren’t experiments. They’re team members.
 And they’ve transformed how we work.
Today, what used to take me five days now takes just one.
 We’ve eliminated 60–70% of the manual work that once slowed our teams down — and unlocked time for creativity, leadership, and innovation.
This is why I say that Entrepreneurship Mastery isn’t just for entrepreneurs — it’s for exponential entrepreneurs.
Yes, you’ll learn traditional business growth systems — webinars, email funnels, offers — but you’ll also learn how to deploy AI into every step of those systems.

Because the future of entrepreneurship isn’t about working harder.
 It’s about building smarter.
Nora took that idea and ran with it.
She went back to her company, Alba Health, and built her own AI employees — one for writing product descriptions, another for marketing content, another for customer communications.
Takeaway:
 AI doesn’t replace your creativity.
 It amplifies it — freeing you to lead, innovate, and grow exponentially.
Lesson 5: Start Building a Movement
This, to me, is the pinnacle of entrepreneurship — and it was the biggest shift Nora made.
In my talk at Mindvalley University, I shared why movements matter more than companies.
A company sells a product.
 A movement sells a belief.
When people buy a product, they might use it once.
 When they join a movement, they carry it into their identity.
That’s what Nora realized.
A few weeks after Mindvalley University, she was preparing for a breakfast event in London — a gathering of journalists, influencers, and partners. She was about to give a talk about her company, Alba Health, and its groundbreaking gut microbiome testing for children.
But while she was on the way there, she flipped through her notes from my talk.
 One line caught her attention:
“Build bigger than yourself. Don’t build a product. Build a movement.”
She stopped.
 Fifteen minutes before going on stage, she opened ChatGPT on her phone and restructured her entire presentation.
When she took the mic, she began with this:
“This isn’t a product presentation. This is a movement. And every one of you here has been handpicked because you can help us lead it.”
Her marketing manager froze — no one knew what was coming next.
But when the talk ended, every journalist and influencer in the room came up to her asking, “How can I contribute to this?”
The following week, her brand was everywhere — magazines, podcasts, social media.
 Her story went viral.
In just one week, her website saw more traffic than the previous three months combined.
 Sales skyrocketed.
 And her team was working late nights, even packaging orders until 11 p.m., just to keep up.
But here’s the beauty:
 Because she had already implemented Daniel’s free assessment funnel, my email sequence model, and her new AI systems — the surge didn’t break her business.
 It scaled it.
That’s the power of building a movement.
 When you stand for something bigger than your product, the world rushes in to help you build it.
