Hi [First Name],
Let’s be honest—this time of year can feel like trying to sprint a marathon that started back in January. Thanksgiving leftovers are barely gone, and suddenly we’re juggling year-end deadlines, holiday parties, and the gift-buying pressure. It’s no wonder December often feels like a swirling vortex of burnout.
But what if I told you there’s a way to flip the script on stress?
Today, I want to share an insight that could completely rewire how you handle stress—not just during the holiday madness, but in life overall. It’s backed by science and so simple that it might just blow your mind.
And the best part? It’s already working for people like you.
The Experiment That Proved Stress Can Be Your Ally
Picture this: two groups of students, both facing high-stakes situations.
Group 1 is about to play a major sports game. They’re nervous—but in a good way. Their hearts are racing, adrenaline is surging, but they feel ready to crush it.
Group 2 is preparing for a huge exam. Same adrenaline, same rapid heartbeats—but instead of confidence, they feel dread, panic, even a mental shutdown.
Same body response, two wildly different outcomes.
This got psychologist Jeremy Jamieson wondering: What if it’s not the stress itself, but how we interpret it that makes the difference?
So, Jamieson ran an experiment. He handed a simple note to half the students taking the GRE (the academic version of climbing Mount Everest):
“People think that feeling anxious while taking a standardized test will make them do poorly on the test. However, recent research suggests that arousal doesn’t hurt performance on these tests and can even help performance—people who feel anxious during a test might actually do better. This means that you shouldn’t feel concerned if you do feel anxious while taking today’s GRE test. If you find yourself feeling anxious, simply remind yourself that your arousal could be helping you do well.”
The results were jaw-dropping.
The students who didn’t get the note scored 706. But those who read the tiny note? They scored 770. That’s a 9% boost—just by reframing how they thought about stress.
Why This Matters for You
This study reveals something extraordinary: stress isn’t the villain it’s made out to be. It’s how we perceive stress that determines whether it drags us down or lifts us up.
Stress boils down to two factors:
1. Biochemistry—the physical sensations (racing heart, sweaty palms, adrenaline).
2. Belief—the story you tell yourself about what those sensations mean.
When you see stress as harmful, it drains you. But when you view it as a sign of your body gearing up for greatness, it becomes your secret weapon.
Rewiring Your Relationship with Stress
Let’s dive into the tools that can help you turn stress into your ally:
1. Reframe Stress in Real Time
Here are two powerful Mindvalley programs to get you started. Both are part of your Mindvalley membership. 
The 5 Elements of Happiness by Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar
Tal is one of the most sought-after professors on positive psychology and used to be one of Harvard’s leading professors. In this Quest, he dives deep into how we can cultivate happiness—even in the face of challenges. If burnout is your main concern, skip to Chapter 5. This section focuses on recovery techniques that will help you bounce back from stress, reset your energy, and find joy again.
Calm Mind by Dr. Caroline Leaf
If your stress feels like it’s spiraling into anxiety or affecting your mental health, Dr. Leaf’s program is essential. She specializes in neuroplasticity—how you can literally rewire your brain to handle stress differently.

2. Tap Into Your Subconscious
Stress patterns often hide in your subconscious. That’s why tools like hypnotherapy can make a huge difference:
Hypnotic Trance for Bliss by Paul McKenna
I’ve mentioned this audio before, but it’s worth repeating. Paul’s hypnotherapy session uses cutting-edge sound technology to rewire your subconscious mind. It’s like a master reset for your stress response.
I’ve personally seen how just seven days of listening can dramatically shift how you experience stress. You’ll start feeling calmer, more balanced, and better equipped to handle whatever life throws your way.
Listen to this on the Mindvalley app and make sure you listen with headphones as it uses unique sound patterns to rewire your brain in 23 mins. 
3. Support Your Body
Stress isn’t just mental—it’s physical. To truly thrive, you need to support your body too. Here’s a list of the most important supplements to help you. I crafted this list with the help of Shawn Wells, one of the leading supplement scientists in the world today and the author of The Ultimate Guide to Supplements on Mindvalley. 

Here’s Shawn’s advice on the Top Ten Supplements for Releasing Stress, Avoiding Burnout and deepening relaxation. The rating is based on their effectiveness on a score of 1 to 10 compared to other similarly studied supplements.
