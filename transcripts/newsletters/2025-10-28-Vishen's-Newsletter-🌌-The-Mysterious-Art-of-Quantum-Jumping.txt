Sub: 🌌 The Mysterious Art of Quantum Jumping

Pre: A strange meditation that could unlock your creativity, intuition, and higher potential.


🌌 The Mysterious Art of Quantum Jumping
By Vishen Lakhiani
Have you ever woken up one morning and thought…
 “How do I actually use the theory of multiple universes to make my life more productive, abundant, and wildly creative?”
Well, I have.
 And I promise you — I wasn’t high, drunk, or on any form of psychedelics.
In this bizarre, beautiful, and slightly mind-warping newsletter, I want to share a story with you.
A story about alternate universes, a wild new mind-bending meditation protocol, and a mentor of mine called Burt Goldman who embodied the phrase 
“You’re never too old to reinvent yourself.”
It’s about Quantum Jumping — a visualization technique so strange, so ahead of its time, that when I first heard it, I thought,
“What the hell are you talking about, Burt?!”
And yet… it changed the trajectory of my career, and possibly my understanding of reality itself.
So… What Is Quantum Jumping, Really?
At its core, Quantum Jumping is a guided visualization practice.
It combines meditation, hypnosis, and visualization to help you access the alpha brainwave state — the mental frequency of creativity and intuition.
Once you’re in that state, you visualize a doorway to another universe and step through it.
On the other side, you meet an alternate you who has already achieved what you desire — perhaps a fitter you, a wealthier you, a more confident you.
 You observe them, interact with them, and eventually merge with them, bringing back their wisdom and energy.
Sounds fantastic? Maybe.
But modern physics — and even modern tech — are beginning to echo the same principles.
How do you understand Quantum Jumping - here’s an animated 6 minute video I created with Burt to explain the concept.

If you know my work, you know that I’ve been deeply influenced by José Silva, the creator of the Silva Method — the original mind-training system that taught millions to access altered states of consciousness for creativity, healing, and intuition.
I never had the chance to meet José. He passed away in 1999.
But I did meet his protégé — his top instructor in the world — a man named Burt Goldman.
Burt wasn’t just a Silva instructor.
He was a modern-day mystic, an artist, a storyteller, and a scientist of consciousness rolled into one.
Under Silva’s guidance, Burt became a master of mind control and manifestation.
But later, he would go on to create his own technique — something that fused deep meditation, quantum theory, and creative imagination into what sounded like a plot from a Marvel movie.
He called it Quantum Jumping.
(Though technically, I gave it that name — over lunch with him in 2008.)
When Burt and I launched Quantum Jumping to the world through Mindvalley, it became the biggest product launch in our company’s history.
Our first million-dollar program. 
It swept across the internet like wildfire, and to this day, it remains one of the most beloved courses ever published on Mindvalley.
Now, almost five years since Burt passed away, Quantum Jumping is still going strong.
And recently, as I was teaching a class for our Manifesting Mastery students, I revisited this technique — and realized it’s more relevant now than ever.
Because today, even Google’s head of quantum computing says that the only explanation for how quantum computers work… is the theory of multiple universes.

Think about that.
The very people building the next generation of computers are starting to sound like mystics.
The Wild, Wonderful Life of Burt Goldman
In my many conversations with Burt, he would tell me stories that sounded like they came out of a Netflix docuseries.
He told me about growing up in Los Angeles and learning to surf on an ironing board — because surfboards hadn’t been invented yet.

He told me about studying under Paramahansa Yogananda, and sitting in a car with the legendary yogi as he visualized a plot of barren land and manifested a temple on it — a story I’ll save for another newsletter.
He told me about working side by side with José Silva, teaching tens of thousands of people the art of entering altered states of mind.
When I became a Silva instructor myself, Burt was my mentor.
In his seventies, he was still experimenting, still innovating. 
Together, we helped him relaunch himself online as The American Monk, a digital meditation teacher before “digital meditation teachers” were even a thing.
But Burt wasn’t content teaching one thing.

He was also writing books (including The Silva Mind Control Method of Mental Dynamics), painting, composing music, building websites, and — my favorite — pioneering a brand new art form that landed him in the International Photography Hall of Fame.
I once asked him,
“Burt, if you could teach the world one thing… what would it be?”
He looked at me, eyes sparkling with mischief, and said:
“I’d teach people how to jump into alternate universes — and meet themselves.”
“Wait… What?” — My First Quantum Jump
At first, I thought he was joking.
Jump into alternate universes? Meet your doppelgänger?
Was Burt finally going senile?
But then he explained.
He told me that during deep meditation, he had learned to visualize a quantum door — a portal into another universe.
On the other side, he’d meet a version of himself who had already mastered the skill he wanted to learn — whether it was painting, photography, or business.
He’d observe this “alternate Burt,” absorb their mindset, and bring it back.
The result?
 At 80 years old, he taught himself painting.
 At 82, he learned photography — and within six months, his photos were featured in museums.
 He wrote, sang, coded, and created like a man half his age.
And so, I tried it.
I invited Burt to a Silva class I was teaching in Anaheim to demonstrate his method.
And what I experienced… I’ll never forget.
It was like my imagination had turned 3D.
Like meeting an infinite library of versions of myself — all whispering, “Here’s how you do it.”
Burt and I would then partner up and launch Quantum Jumping to the world in 2008. And in a moment I’m going to show you how to experience it. 
But I’d like to show you some proof first. 
🎥 The Day I Visited Burt’s Multiverse
This is a 2014 home video I made and edited myself while visiting Burt’s magical home in 2014.
I drove up to his home in Rancho Mirage, California, to film a short video.
That video — which you can now watch on Youtube Here— shows me walking through his gallery of hundreds of paintings and photos.

In the video you’ll notice the prolific amount of art and creations lying all across Burt’s home. 
Why Science Might Be Catching Up
1. Vadim Zeland’s Reality Transurfing
A Soviet quantum physicist named Vadim Zeland proposed a model called Reality Transurfing.
 He believed that all possible versions of your life exist simultaneously in the quantum field — like tracks on a record.
The version of you who’s a billionaire.
 The version of you who’s healed, fit, and vibrant.
 The version of you who’s living in total peace.
You don’t “create” these realities — you choose them.
But here’s the catch:
 When you care too much, when you obsess over your desire, you generate what Zeland calls excess potential — an energetic resistance that actually pushes your goal away.
The universe, seeking balance, introduces obstacles.
The harder you push, the more resistance you create.
Zeland’s solution?
He called it the No Big Deal approach.
You choose what you want, but you don’t cling to it.
You hold your desire lightly — like, “It’d be nice if I had it, but if not, that’s fine too.”
It’s the paradox of manifestation:
The moment you stop needing the thing, the thing starts needing you.
Quantum Jumping embodies this perfectly.
You visit the version of you who already has the result — no desperation, no longing. Just curiosity and merging.
You become the vibration of that reality, and life rearranges itself around you.
2. The Multiverse and Quantum Mechanics
In 1957, physicist Hugh Everett proposed the Many-Worlds Interpretation — that every decision spawns new universes.
 Each of us lives infinite versions of our lives across infinite realities.
Quantum Jumping isn’t saying you’re physically teleporting.
It’s saying you can mentally align with the version of yourself that already exists in another probability field.
It’s not teleportation — it’s resonation.
3. Quantum Computing & The Simulation Hypothesis
Quantum computers process information using particles that exist in multiple states at once — superposition.
 This allows them to explore countless outcomes simultaneously, then “collapse” into the optimal one.
Sound familiar?
 That’s exactly what your consciousness does when you visualize a goal.
Even Elon Musk believes reality works like this.
 He once said:
“There’s a one in billions chance that we’re living in base reality.”
Meaning: if civilizations can create realistic simulations, odds are we’re already inside one.
So what is Quantum Jumping, really?
It’s learning to hack the simulation.
To consciously select your reality upgrade — to “load” a new version of yourself from the infinite multiversal code.
Why It Works (Even If You Don’t Believe It)
Here’s the secret:
Quantum Jumping works because it trains your brain to accept new possibilities as real.
Your subconscious stops saying, “That’s impossible.”
 It starts saying, “That’s already me.”
And when that belief becomes embodied — when your nervous system accepts it — your actions, decisions, and opportunities shift.
You start sliding into that version of reality.
That’s the mechanism behind every miracle, every creative breakthrough, every overnight transformation.
Not magic — mental software upgrade.

We’ll explore the science and spirituality of this practice — and I’ll guide you through what might be your first-ever Quantum Jump.
Because somewhere, out there in the multiverse, there’s a version of you who already has everything you’ve been working toward.
Let’s go meet them. 
This is your living initiation, where science meets spirit, energy meets embodiment, and awakening becomes a lived experience.
Across two transformative days, you’ll learn directly from a lineup of world-class teachers, mystics, and energy masters — each guiding you through a different dimension of awakening. 
We hope to see you there. 
With love,

 Vishen
