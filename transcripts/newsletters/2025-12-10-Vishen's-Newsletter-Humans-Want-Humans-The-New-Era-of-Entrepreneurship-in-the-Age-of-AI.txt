Humans Want Humans: The New Era of Entrepreneurship in the Age of AI
By Vishen Lakhiani

We are living through one of the strangest moments in the history of the internet.
AI is now generating more content in a single day than humans produced in the first decade of social media. Blog posts. Captions. Videos. Articles. Websites. Even entire “personalities” are now being created by machines.
And here’s the wild thing:

All this AI-generated content is now being fed back into the AI models. 
Which then produces even more AI-generated content.
Which then gets scraped and recycled again.
A feedback loop of synthetic ideas feeding synthetic ideas feeding synthetic ideas.
A perpetual motion machine of digital junk.
And the result?
The internet feels increasingly unreal.
Polished. Predictable. Hollow.
The texture of real human expression is disappearing.
People can sense it.
People can feel it.
And people are getting tired.
This is why inside Mindvalley, we have begun repeating a simple mantra in every strategic conversation:
“Humans want humans…”
In a world drowning in artificial content, humanity becomes the premium.
Realness becomes the differentiator.
Presence becomes the product.
And your personal story becomes your greatest asset.
Let me show you what I mean through three powerful shifts we’re seeing inside our own ecosystem: 
1. A Simple Story That Says Everything
This story says a lot about where the world is heading. Years ago, the late Bob Proctor recorded a beautiful Abundance Meditation in our office.

 He grabbed my old iPhone, sat down, and recorded it in one take.
You can hear a bit of room noise. It’s not “studio perfect.” But it’s Bob. Raw. Present. Human.
Recently, we tried something: We cleaned up the audio with AI. Polished it. Smoothed out the rough edges.
And our community hated it.
Emails started pouring in:
“Please bring back the old version.”
 “I want the original Bob.”
 “It sounds too clean. I lost the feeling.”
Think about that for a second.
People preferred the imperfect, slightly noisy, very human original to the AI-polished version.
That’s the era we’re stepping into.
The world has more “perfect” content than ever. But people are choosing realness, even when it’s rough around the edges.
2. The Rise of Live Learning: Why Live Teaching on Zoom Is Exploding 

A few months ago, we launched Mindvalley Academy, our new platform dedicated entirely to real-time learning with real-world teachers.
Not assistants.Not facilitators. Not pre-recorded videos shot three years ago. And absolutely nothing generated by AI.
We made a commitment: Human beings will show up LIVE to teach human beings.
And the results shocked even us.
Our first six micro-degrees that launched quietly, with almost no major campaigns — are already on track to generate close to $30 million a year.
And the student feedback has been extraordinary.
Why?
Because after consuming endless information on the internet, people are hungry for transformation.
They want the nuance of lived experience.
 They want energy in real time.
 They want to ask questions.
 They want to feel seen.
They want humans.
That’s why Mindvalley Academy worked so fast. It wasn’t because of clever AI tricks or conversion hacks.

It’s simply aligning with what the world is organically gravitating toward:

Humans want humans.
3. We sold the majority of tickets to our next event ONE YEAR in Advance…never seen anything like this in 15 years of events. 

Here’s another example.
When we quietly opened ticket sales for Mindvalley University 2026 — a full year early — something unbelievable happened.
We sold 55% of all tickets in the first three days.
This was 500% faster than any year in our history.
Why were families, entrepreneurs, students, and seekers rushing to book a transformational event in a completely different country… twelve months in advance?
The answer is simple:
People are craving in-person human connection like never before.
Here’s the truth:
No AI transcript can replicate the feeling of dancing with thousands of souls under the Estonian sunset.
No chatbot can replicate the moment a strange conversation with a stranger that turns into a lifelong friendship.
No algorithm can reproduce the magnetic energy of a teacher who walks into the room with fire in their voice and wisdom in their presence.
Mindvalley was born from this ethos:
Real humans. Real teachers. Real transformation. Real community.

That’s what’s selling out Mindvalley University (July 20-Aug 2 | Estonia).
But the real reason is simple, in a world where everything feels digital: Humans want humans.
4. The Personal Brand Awakening: Why I Removed the Mindvalley Podcast
This next part may surprise you.
A few months ago, I made a decision that shocked our team:
I took down the Mindvalley podcast.
Not because I didn’t love it or it didn’t perform.
But because the world has changed.
People don’t want to follow a podcast about a company — even if the company is beloved.
People don’t wake up thinking: “I wonder what this company has to say today.”
They wake up thinking:
“Whose perspective do I trust?”
 “Whose journey do I resonate with?”
 “Whose voice feels real to me?”
They want to follow a human being.
So instead, I shifted my energy toward the Vishen Lakhiani YouTube channel.
And here’s what happened:
My personal brand started growing faster than Mindvalley’s brand.
Not because I’m more interesting than Mindvalley.
But because founders carry something companies cannot replicate:
A heartbeat.
A journey.
A wound.
A perspective shaped by fire.
This is when something Daniel Priestley told me hit me harder than ever.
Daniel — one of the world’s leading entrepreneurship teachers and the most frequent guest on Diary of a CEO — said:
“I own seven companies. But I invest heavily in my personal brand because it drives traffic to all seven.
People follow people first.”
He’s right.
Creators. Coaches. Founders. Even CEOs of big companies. The ones who show up as humans  not as polished corporate avatars are the ones cutting through the noise.
Again, Humans want humans.
This is a fundamental truth of human psychology.
So What Does the Future Hold for Entrepreneurs and Founders?
Here are six shifts I believe every entrepreneur, coach, and creator must pay attention to — because they are coming fast, and they will reshape everything we know about influence and business.
#1. AI Will Dominate Content Which Means Information Is No Longer Your Value
We’re entering a world where anyone can publish. Anyone can “sound smart.” Anyone can generate a polished, perfect script in seconds.
So the edge is no longer what you know. The edge becomes who you are while you teach it.
Your life lessons, your original stories, your realness, these become essential.
When I record content these days, I don’t bother ensuring my hair is perfectly combed. I don’t fuss with lighting or studio setups. None of that seems to matter.
Here’s proof:


My recent clip about being stopped by the FBI at US Airport recorded while I was literally walking through a mall in Miami hit 1.5 million views.
Meanwhile, videos I film in a proper studio with full lighting setups don’t even come close.
Why? Because humans want humans.
Not polished. Not perfection. Not filters. Only Presence. Realness. Story.
#2. Your Personal Story Becomes Your Moat
In an AI-powered internet, realness becomes rare.
So embrace your imperfections, lived experience and your emotional honesty.
Your story is the new currency, your authentic brand and a major competitive advantage.
Here’s what I personally do:
I keep a digital list of stories, over 200 of them gathered from my life. Moments with spiritual teachers. Traumatic incidents from childhood. Insights that struck me while sitting with a shaman on a plant medicine journey.
I write these stories down, refine them, and reuse them in my content.
For example, the true story of Bob Proctor coming to our office (that you saw at the start of this newsletter) I’ve used that story in two newsletters. And every time, people light up. Why? Because it’s real.
Your stories are your soul’s fingerprints. AI can’t replicate them. And audiences crave them.
#3. Live Teaching Will Outperform Recorded Courses
People don’t want more videos. They want presence.
They want your eyes, your energy, your intuition responding in real time. Transformation happens live, not later.
This is why I’ve shifted almost entirely to live teaching.
I haven’t recorded a new pre-recorded program in over a year but I’ve clocked over 100 hours of live teaching on Zoom.
And the response?
 Electric.
I enjoy it more because I get to feel my audience’s energy.
 And they love it because loyalty is built through interaction, not information.
This is the future of online education:
 Real humans. Real time. Real transformation.
#4. In-Person Events, Seminars, and Workshops Will Explode
The world is starving for community.
Community isn’t a “nice to have” anymore. Community is becoming the new currency of entrepreneurship.
Whatever business you run  a restaurant, a longevity clinic, a coaching program on Instagram your secret weapon will be bringing your people together.
Engage in the comments. Host real-world meetups. Create spaces where your customers can connect with you and with each other.
Recently in London, I invited 40 students from our Manifesting Mastery program to join me for dinner. It turned into one of the most beautiful evenings I’ve had this year.
Real connection creates raving fans. Raving fans create movements. 
Movements create unstoppable businesses.
#5. Your Founder Brand Will Outperform Your Company Brand
People don’t follow logos. People follow leaders.
So yes,  create Instagram pages for each of your companies. Do the branding. Build the funnel.
But here’s the truth:
80% of your energy should go into your founder brand.
Because companies may rise and fall. But your founder brand, if you build it right, can outlive you.
Look at Bob Proctor. He passed away in 2021. Yet his content, his clips, his teachings — they’re everywhere. People are still quoting him today. A strong founder brand becomes immortal.
#6. The Future Belongs to Entrepreneurs Who Combine AI With Authenticity
Let AI make you faster. Let AI handle the repetition, the workload, the technical polish.
But let your humanity be the masterpiece. Your stories.Your scars. Your worldview. Your vibe.
That’s what makes you unforgettable.
Here’s an example:
This very section of this article is being written in collaboration with AI.
I’m pacing around my room, speaking out loud to one of my team members. It’s being recorded, transcribed, and sent directly into ChatGPT.
AI is helping me grammar check,polish, and structure this newsletter.
But every idea, every insight, every metaphor, every story is coming straight from my heart and lived experience.
This is the model. AI is the engine.
But YOU are the conductor.
And the entrepreneurs who master this synergy who blend speed with soul, efficiency with essence will lead the next decade of business.
