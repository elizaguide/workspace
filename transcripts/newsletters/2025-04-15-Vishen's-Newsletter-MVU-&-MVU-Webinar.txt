Sub: This is Where You Belong This Summer

Preheader: When 300 people joined me in Spain, I knew we were onto something. Welcome to the story of Mindvalley University.

It Started as a Wild Experiment…
Now It’s One of the Most Transformational Experiences in the World
Let me take you back to early 2016.
At the time, I was living in Malaysia. My kids were going to an American school. Life was good—but something inside me felt stuck. You probably know that feeling.
Same meetings. Same conversations. Same coffee shop.
No matter how much you achieve, a quiet voice whispers:
 “There’s more.”
I wanted to shake things up. I wanted to give my children a broader view of the world—and maybe start a new family tradition.
So I came up with this idea:
Every summer, we’d move to a different city for one month. A new place. A new culture. A shared experience.
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized…
That could feel isolating.
My kids love making friends. I thrive in the community. Exploring a city alone—especially as a family—can get lonely fast.
So, what if…
What if we didn’t do it alone?
What if other families joined us?
What if people passionate about growth, learning, and adventure could come together in one city?
I had visited Barcelona before, and the city had blown me away. The beauty, the vibe, the culture—it was the perfect place to begin.
So I opened Facebook and typed a post in February 2016.
“Hey everyone—this summer, I’m moving to Barcelona for a month with my kids. Want to come too?”
I thought 20 people might be interested.
Instead, 170 people commented saying they just might do it.
And I laughed to myself:
“Liars.”
Back then, I wasn’t that well-known. My book hadn’t hit #1 on Amazon. Mindvalley Membership hadn’t even launched yet. Most people knew me as a successful online blogger—but not someone you’d move countries to be with.
But here’s where it gets wild: 
300 people actually came. 
Yes, 300 PEOPLE MOVED TO BARCELONA WITH ME. 
And just like that… a spontaneous experiment turned into something extraordinary.
Image Below: The original post that started the movement:

The First Summer: The Barcelona Experiment

We weren’t sure what we were doing. There was no roadmap, no structure. Just a bunch of us moving to a city with hope, curiosity, and kids in tow.
We rented Airbnbs in the same neighborhood.
We turned a co-working space into a shared campus.
We set up a classroom for our children.
And I called a few Mindvalley authors—Lisa Nichols, Marisa Peer, and others—and asked them to join us in Barcelona.
To my surprise, many of them said yes.
They flew in to teach, speak, and hang out. Not for fame. Not for money. But because they believed in the vision: a better way to live and learn, surrounded by community.
In that one month:
People created mastermind groups in coffee shops.
They hosted spontaneous workshops in their apartments.
New businesses were launched.
Children formed friendships that felt like summer camp—but way more conscious.

And at the end of it all… people cried.
Not because it was over.
But because they had experienced something they didn’t even know they were missing.
They had found a tribe.
They had rediscovered their spark.
They had felt fully alive—maybe for the first time in years.
That month became known as “The Barcelona Experiment.”
And it lit the fuse for what would eventually become Mindvalley University.
Why We Called It a University (Even When It Wasn’t)


When I saw what was happening, I went to my team.
“Can we create some infrastructure around this? We have 300 people in Barcelona. Let’s give them something more.”
So we launched a project: Mindvalley University.
We called it a “university” not because it was academic, but because it felt like we were all students again—learning, growing, and reimagining life together.
That summer, we built: A co-working campus for the adults, A classroom space for the kids, A community experience unlike anything I had seen before
And something clicked.
We weren’t just on vacation. We were reinventing education.
We were rediscovering life.
Mindvalley University Today

Since 2017, Mindvalley University has grown into an annual tradition.
Every summer—except during the pandemic—we choose a new city and transform it into a living, breathing, global campus.
We’ve gathered in:
- Tallinn, Estonia
- 
- Pula, Croatia
- 
- Lisbon, Portugal
- 
- … and now, in 2025, we’re heading to Amsterdam.
- 
This isn’t a conference. It’s not a retreat
.
It’s a 2-week immersive experience of what life could be like—if learning, family, health, and personal growth were at the center.

This Isn’t Just for Families

Here’s something most people don’t realize:
Yes, we created MVU with families in mind. But today:
- 80% of participants come as individuals or couples.
- 
- 20% come with children and get access to our incredible youth programs.
- 
- Many are digital nomads, creators, entrepreneurs, or just curious seekers.
- 
Everyone comes for one thing: Reinvention
A new model of living, learning, and belonging — that society easily suppresses out of us. 

Learn more on how you can break the cycle.
Why It Changes You

You learn from top teachers by day.
You connect with visionary minds over dinner.
You explore a city not as a tourist—but as a co-creator.
And what happens is subtle… then seismic.
You shift. You expand. You remember who you really are.
This year, in Amsterdam, we’ll gather from August 4–17 to do it all again.
MVU Is a Talent Incubator

One of the most magical things about MVU is how it creates leaders.
It doesn’t just attract talent—it activates it.
🎤 Jimmy Naraine came as an attendee—now he’s a bestselling author and Mindvalley trainer.
 🎤 Dawn Hoang showed up as a student—today, she’s a sought-after intuitive advisor and kundalini activator.
 🎤 Regan Hillyer attended quietly in the early years—now she’s one of the most in-demand manifestation coaches on the planet.
 🎤 Niraj Naik found his spark here—now known globally for SOMA Breathwork.
At MVU, we don’t just bring in world-class teachers. We discover them.
If you have something powerful to share, we’ll give you the space to teach, inspire, and transform others. 

All you have to do is get a ticket to attend MVU Amsterdam and apply with us to speak. 
This Is a Playground for Creators
There’s something magnetic that happens when you bring 1,500 conscious creators into one space.
YouTubers film their breakthroughs. Podcasters record in-the-moment realizations.
Writers fill journals with lightning-bolt insights.

And these stories ripple out across the world.
Not through marketing.
But through truth.
When you attend MVU, you don’t just learn—you become part of the story.
Mindvalley University 2025: Amsterdam


This August, we take over Amsterdam—one of the world’s most creative, progressive, and electric cities with 1,500+ change-makers, creators, families, and visionaries.

But if you are still unsure, let me show you, 

Find out LIVE with me if Mindvalley University is for you?


Let me ask you something:
Do you feel like life has more to offer—but you haven’t found “your people” yet?
Do you dream of raising your kids in a different way, or building a life beyond the 9–5 grind?
Do you believe education, community, and healing should be joyful, adventurous, and whole?
Then, Yes!  This is for you and you are looking for Reinvention. 
Reinvention is not a 5-year plan. With the right environment, tribe, and tools, it can happen in weeks.

Reinvention is not for everyone.
If you’re okay staying the same… If you’re afraid to challenge the norm…
If you think personal growth is a “nice to have,” not a way of life…
This probably isn’t for you.
But if you’re ready—truly ready—to live, learn, and grow differently…
We’ll see you in Amsterdam. 
If you want to go deep, i’ll see you on Thursday where we’re discuss 3 shifts that trigger reinvention

Some ideas change lives. Some ideas change the world.
This one does both.
See you there,
 Vishen
