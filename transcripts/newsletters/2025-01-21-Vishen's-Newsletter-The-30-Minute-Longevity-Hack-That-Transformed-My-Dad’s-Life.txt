Newsletter: The 30-Minute Longevity Hack That Transformed My Dad’s Life

Hey there,
Let me ask you something: When you imagine yourself at 70 or 80, what do you see? Are you climbing stairs with ease? Dancing at your grandkids’ wedding? Or are you struggling to even get up from the couch?
Here’s the thing about longevity: It’s not just about living longer—it’s about living better. That means adding more years to your life and more life to your years. And that’s what Day 2 of Future Human was all about: cracking the code on longevity, vitality, and thriving well into your 80s, 90s, and beyond.
(By the way, if you missed it, I just posted some of my favorite photos from Day 2 on Instagram. Go check them out! See if you can guess which of the three elderly ladies in the first photo is my mom. Hint: She’s rocking the kind of energy that’ll make you wonder if she found the fountain of youth.)


Now, back to longevity. On Day 2, we heard from some of the world’s top minds, including Dave Asprey, Ronan Diego, Lisa Nichols, and others. They talked about everything from biohacking and breathwork to the power of community. But one thing stood out to me—something so simple yet profound—it might just be the ultimate hack for staying young.

It’s your muscles.
Muscles: Your Secret Weapon for Longevity
Let me explain. There’s this fascinating concept I learned at Future Human. One of the strongest predictors of longevity is muscle strength. Why? Because your muscles are directly tied to so many vital functions: mobility, energy levels, and even your ability to maintain a sense of independence and connection as you age.
But here’s the kicker. You don’t need to spend hours in the gym. You don’t need to aim for the “gym bro” look or worry about getting a six-pack. This isn’t about vanity—it’s about functional strength.
In fact, you can dramatically improve your muscle health—and your lifespan—with just 30 minutes a week.
My Dad’s Journey: From Struggling to Thriving

Let me share a story to show you how powerful this is.
When my dad turned 70, he got some devastating news from his doctor. He was in such poor shape that the doctor estimated he might only have five years left to live.
Hearing this broke my heart. So, I decided to do something about it. I introduced my dad to Lorenzo Delano, one of the brilliant minds behind Mindvalley’s 10X Fitness program.
Now, Lorenzo didn’t throw my dad into some crazy boot camp. Instead, he guided him through a simple, science-backed protocol: 30 minutes in the gym, once a week. That’s it.
When my dad started, he could leg press 80 kilograms (~176 lbs). After just four weeks, his strength increased to 150 kilograms (~330 lbs). That’s an 80% increase in strength—with less than 2 hours of total gym time.
The transformation was incredible. Suddenly, my dad could hike, climb stairs, and do things he hadn’t been able to do in years. A few years later, he and I even went hiking in the desert of Jordan at Petra—a feat that would’ve been impossible before.
What’s happening here? It’s all about reversing sarcopenia—the natural muscle loss that starts in your 30s and accelerates as you age. The best part? According to Lorenzo, reversing this muscle loss takes just 2 hours of exercise per year.
Yes, you read that right. Two hours a year can keep your muscles from wasting away and help you maintain the strength you had at 30 well into your 70s.

The Science Behind 10X: Minimum Effective Dose
So how does this work? The magic of 10X lies in something called the minimum effective dose. It’s a concept inspired by Doug McGuff, MD, author of the groundbreaking book Body by Science.
Here’s the gist: Instead of spending hours at the gym, you focus on five key exercises that give you the biggest bang for your buck.
Here are the exercises we recommend:
1. Leg Press
2. Lat Pulldown
3. Chest Press
4. Cable Row
5. Shoulder Press
And here’s how you do them:
- Use 65–70% of your one-rep max (the heaviest weight you can lift once).
- Do 1 set of 10–14 reps per exercise.
- Each rep takes 5 seconds: 2 seconds pushing or pulling, and 3 seconds on the return.
- Move from one machine to the next without resting.
This protocol puts your muscles under just enough strain to stimulate growth, without overworking them. And because it’s so efficient, the whole session takes only 30 minutes, including time to check into the gym and grab your stuff from your locker.
Do this once or twice a week, and you’ll not only reverse muscle loss—you’ll feel stronger, more energized, and more capable than ever.
Take this case study of a 10X user from the US Military. Mary (name changed) was already fit as she was in the army. But check out her before and after results when she started with 10X. The most impressive is that her body fat fell from 43% to 23% in 6 months and her total workout time in the gym was 40 mins PER WEEK.

Your Longevity Starts Now
If you’re intrigued by this, I highly recommend trying it out for yourself. You don’t need fancy equipment or hours of free time. All you need is a gym, 30 minutes, and a commitment to your health.
Here’s the one-page guide we provided at Future Human.
