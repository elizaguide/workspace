Email Subject: The Myth of American Freedom

Blog: Subject: The Myth of American Freedom 


I’ve just returned from a two-week road trip across America with my kids — a journey that rekindled my deep love for this country… and also stirred a quiet ache I couldn’t ignore. 
We didn’t stick to the usual tourist spots. Sure, we saw the Statue of Liberty and wandered through New York and Boston. 
But we also went deep into the heartland — driving across South Dakota, visiting the cowboy town of Cody, WY, camping under the stars in Yellowstone, standing beneath Mount Rushmore, watching small-town rodeos, even learning to shoot guns.
It was beautiful. Awe-inspiring. A window into the raw soul of this nation.
One morning, I was about to post a photo of my kids and I standing under the American flag — captioned “The Land of the Free.”
But my thumb hovered.Because something inside me whispered: That’s not entirely true anymore.
And that’s what today’s email is about.
It’s about freedom — what it really means, why it’s vanishing, and why we should all be concerned. Not just Americans, but all of us.




🧭 Where does America actually rank in freedom?
I was shocked to learn that America no longer ranks in the top 10 most free countries in the world.
 In fact — not even the top 15.
According to the 2024 Human Freedom Index, America ranks #17 — and it’s still falling.
 Recent events, growing surveillance, media consolidation, and the erosion of civil rights are accelerating the decline.
Many experts now warn: the U.S. is on the brink of autocracy.
Why do Northern European and select Asian countries consistently outrank America in freedom?
Because they have:
- Strong protections for civil liberties
- 
- Public education systems that teach critical thinking
- 
- Universal healthcare that actually works
- 
- Transparent governance
- 
- Independent media (not owned by six conglomerates)
- 
- Smart regulation that keeps corporate influence in check
- 
Meanwhile, America continues to erode its democratic foundations.
Let’s break it down — with four global indexes that reveal the full picture.
#1: Human Freedom Index
Measured by the Cato Institute and Fraser Institute.
 This combines personal freedom (speech, religion, movement) with economic freedom (property rights, regulatory fairness).
Top countries: Switzerland, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Estonia
 America? Ranked #17 — tied with the UK.
Why?
 Because of increasing political polarization, declining rule of law, and growing restrictions on bodily autonomy and protest rights.

#2: Press Freedom Index
Measured by Reporters Without Borders.
 Evaluates media independence, transparency, and journalist safety.
Top countries: Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands
 America? Ranked #57.
Why?
 Because six corporations own 90% of U.S. media.
 Because cable networks profit from division.
 Because journalists are threatened and discredited.
 Because truth is no longer profitable.


#3: Democracy Index
Published by The Economist Intelligence Unit.
 Measures electoral process, civil liberties, political culture, and government function.
Top countries: Norway, New Zealand, Iceland, Sweden, Switzerland
 America? Labeled a “flawed democracy” — currently around #28.
The country that once exported democracy… now struggles to protect its own.

#4 Internet Freedom
Measured by Freedom House.
Assesses censorship, surveillance, and digital expression.
Top countries: Iceland, Estonia, Canada
America? Not even in the top 10 — and declining.
Why?
Policies like requiring visa applicants to hand over social media accounts are undermining digital privacy — and global trust in U.S. tech.
Each index tells the same story:
America is falling behind.

So What Does This Tell Us?
The idea that America is the freest nation on Earth does not hold up against the four global freedom indices.
It’s a myth — one we must lovingly but urgently dismantle if we are to build something better.
🕊️ What Real Freedom Actually Looks Like
Real freedom isn’t fireworks and an anthem.
It’s not red, white, and blue — it’s truth, agency, and dignity.
Here’s what real freedom looks like in a modern, awakened society:
✅ Real Freedom Means…
🔓 Freedom from fear
You can walk down the street without fearing bullets, badges, or bills.
📚 Freedom to learn truthfully
Your education isn't censored by political agendas or banned books.
🩺 Freedom to heal
You can access affordable, evidence-based healthcare — without bankrupting your family.
🗳 Freedom to vote — and have it count
Your voice isn’t silenced by gerrymandering, voter suppression, or money in politics.
🧠 Freedom of thought
Algorithms don’t control your beliefs. You think for yourself — not how the algorithm trained you to.
🏳️‍🌈 Freedom to be who you are
Regardless of your race, gender, sexuality, faith, or background — you’re treated with dignity, not suspicion.
💻 Freedom online
The internet is a tool for empowerment, not surveillance, manipulation, or corporate censorship.
🌍 Freedom to roam
You can travel, work, and live across borders without bureaucratic chains — as a citizen of the Earth.
🤝 Freedom to rise — together
Economic mobility is real. Success isn’t reserved for the zip code you were born into.
🕊 Freedom from war
You don’t have to fund invasions while schools crumble and families go hungry.
That’s what freedom looks like.
Not something you claim.
Something you create.
🔒 But here’s what Americans still aren’t free from…
🍟 Freedom from poisoned food
Michelle Obama planted vegetables. Conservatives shouted, “You’re taking away our freedom!”
Now RFK Jr. echoes the same message — and it’s patriotic.
The hypocrisy is wild.
But at least now both sides agree: America’s food system is broken.
Americans now die five years younger than their European counterparts.

🔫 Freedom from gun terror
 You want a handgun? Fine. A hunting rifle? Cool.
 But why the hell are AR-15s on the streets?
 Kids are doing active shooter drills in kindergarten.
 That’s not freedom. That’s national PTSD.
⛓️ Freedom from mass incarceration
 America is 4% of the world’s population — but holds 20% of the world’s prisoners.
 Over 1% of Americans are behind bars.
 Private prisons profit. Minorities suffer.
 Land of the free… unless you're poor, Black, or unlucky.
🗳 Freedom for your vote to actually count
 Wyoming: 580,000 people. California: 39 million.
 Same number of Senators. That’s not democracy — that’s dilution.
 And Puerto Rico?
 3 million American citizens.
 No vote in Congress. No vote for President.
 How? Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They just don’t get to vote.
 Make it make sense.



✊ So What If We Flipped the Script?
Young Americans chant: Free Gaza. Free Palestine. Free Cuba. Free Iran.
But what if we said: Free America.
- Free America from propaganda disguised as news.
- Free America from the grip of Rupert Murdoch.
- Free America from billionaires who can buy elections.
- Free America from a system where corporations are people, but people are disposable.
- Free America from mass shootings — and the 25+ million assault rifles still circulating.
- Free America from the impact of foreign lobbies, like the Israel lobby, which spends over $100 million/year influencing U.S. politicians.
- Free America from racism disguised as patriotism.
- Free America from cruel policies that tear undocumented families apart.
But mostly…
Free America from the illusion of freedom. 
Because here’s the truth: 
When America is free… Gaza will be free. So will the world.
When America sneezes, the world catches a cold. And we, the rest of the world, are sick of suffering the consequences.
🕊️ This isn’t about red vs blue.
It’s about truth vs illusion.
It’s about reclaiming what “freedom” really means — beyond slogans, beyond partisanship, beyond the BS. 
And it starts with us — speaking up, seeing clearly, and refusing to settle for myth over meaning.
In love, the American spirit of rebellion, and deep respect for what this amazing country could still become,
