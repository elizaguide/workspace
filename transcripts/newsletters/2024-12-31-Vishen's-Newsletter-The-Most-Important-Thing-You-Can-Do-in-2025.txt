The Most Important Resolution for 2025

Hey there,
As we stand at the brink of 2025, let me ask you a question:
What’s the one thing you could commit to every single week in 2025 that would create the biggest impact on your life?
Think about it. What single act, if done consistently, could make the difference between merely surviving another year and absolutely thriving?
This question came up in a podcast interview I recently did, and I knew I had to share my answer with you because it could genuinely transform your life.
Here’s the thing: This isn’t a resolution. It’s not about hitting the gym five times a week or meditating for 30 minutes every morning. Those are great habits, but this is something bigger.
It’s not a goal either. Goals are outcomes. This is a practice—one that takes less than 19 seconds to start (yes, I timed it) but could make 2025 your most transformational year yet.
What is it?
Non-Negotiable Learning Time
It sounds simple, almost too simple. But stick with me because this idea is deceptively powerful.
Here’s how it works:
In any job or career—or even life in general—there’s a danger of stagnation if all you ever do is “the work.” You get caught up in your daily tasks, putting out fires, and meeting deadlines. But when you carve out even a small amount of sacred, untouchable time to grow yourself, the results are exponential.
And I mean that literally.
Let me explain.
If you commit to improving by just 1% every single day, do you know how much better you’d be at the end of a year? Most people guess they’d double their abilities. But that’s not even close.
Here’s the math (and yes, I love math for stuff like this):
If you improve by 1% daily, by the end of the year, you’ll be 37.78 times better. That’s a 3,778% improvement!
This is the power of compounding—not in your finances, but in your skills, knowledge, and capabilities.
What Is Non-Negotiable Learning Time?
This idea comes from management theory. It’s the principle that if all you do is work, you’ll eventually stagnate. But if you carve out sacred, untouchable time to grow, you’ll unlock exponential growth—not just in your career but in every area of your life.
Here’s how it works:
If you work 40 hours a week, take two of those hours and dedicate them solely to learning. And I mean true learning—not multitasking with a podcast while driving, but intentional, focused learning.
If you’re a business owner, those two hours could be spent diving into books on leadership, studying the latest AI innovations, or taking a class on scaling a company.
If you’re a parent, maybe you spend that time learning about emotional intelligence, mindful parenting, or financial literacy to set your family up for success.
The key is this: It’s non-negotiable. No matter how busy life gets, work or errands can never creep into this sacred time.
Why This Simple Practice Works
Here’s where it gets exciting.
Most people think of growth as linear—like climbing a staircase, one step at a time. But real growth is exponential. It’s like compound interest in a bank account, except the currency is your skills, knowledge, and capabilities.
Let me break it down with some math:
If you improved by just 1% every day for 365 days, how much better would you be at the end of the year? Most people guess they’d double their abilities. But here’s the truth:
Because of the compounding effect, you’d be 37.78 times better. That’s a 3,778% improvement. Imagine walking into 2026 as a version of yourself that’s 37 times more skilled, confident, and capable.
That’s the power of non-negotiable learning time.
How to Start Non-Negotiable Learning Time
1. Block It Off
2. Take two hours a week. Put it on your calendar. Treat it like an unmissable meeting.

1. Focus on Real Learning
2. This isn’t about passive entertainment like podcasts or YouTube videos. True learning happens when you actively engage—reading a book, taking a course, or watching a Mindvalley Quest while taking notes.

1. Apply What You Learn
2. Learning is useless if you don’t act on it. Use this time to reflect on how you can apply these lessons to your life immediately.
For me, this means attending Mindvalley Mastery classes every Tuesday and Thursday. But I’ll admit, I’ve slipped up—letting work take over and skipping these sessions. That changes in 2025. My resolution is simple: Protect my learning time at all costs.

Where Should You Focus in 2025?
If you’re wondering what to focus on during your learning time, here’s where I believe the biggest opportunities lie:
1. AI Mastery
Mark my words: 2025 will be the last “normal” year in history. By 2026, AI will disrupt 50% of white-collar work. The businesses and individuals who adapt to AI will thrive. Those who don’t? They’ll struggle to keep up.
AI is already reshaping industries, from marketing to medicine. For example, I’m currently experimenting with OpenAI’s Sora to create stunning video loops for my keynote slides. The results are mind-blowing.
Start exploring tools like this now. The earlier you adopt, the bigger your advantage will be.
2. Longevity Protocols
Imagine having all the money, success, and freedom you’ve ever wanted—but no health to enjoy it. Health is wealth, and longevity is the ultimate currency.
We’re entering a new era of health science. Experts like Peter Diamandis believe we’re approaching “longevity escape velocity,” where advancements in medicine could extend human life indefinitely.
Dive into resources from Mindvalley experts like Dave Asprey, Ben Greenfield, and Ronan Diego. Learn how to slow aging, enhance vitality, and maybe even unlock decades more to live out your dreams.
3. Manifesting Mastery
Manifesting is no longer a fringe idea—it’s a proven strategy for success. In fact, Cambridge Dictionary just named “manifesting” the Word of the Year.
At its core, manifesting is about turning bold visions into reality. It’s the mindset, energy, and focus that help you move toward your dreams with resilience and purpose.
At Mindvalley, we teach practical techniques to master this skill. Whether you’re setting career goals, building a business, or creating your dream lifestyle, manifesting can accelerate your journey.
Your Role in 2025
Here’s the truth: The world is changing faster than ever. You can either be a spectator, watching it all unfold, or you can step into the driver’s seat and shape your own future.
Non-negotiable learning time is your key to staying ahead. It’s how you grow, evolve, and become 37 times better by this time next year.
So, here’s my challenge to you: Take 19 seconds right now to block out your first two hours of learning time for January. Make it sacred. Make it yours.
And if you’re ready to supercharge your growth, join me at Future Human, Mindvalley’s biggest event ever, happening in Dubai from January 9–12. We’ll dive deep into AI, longevity, and manifesting with the world’s top minds.

Oh, and if you’re tuning into CNN International on New Year’s Eve, I’ll be sharing a special message about how to step into 2025 with purpose and clarity.
I’m live on CNN 10pm tonight (Dec 31st Dubai Time) just after midnight sharing my 2025 message for the world. 

See you then. 
Here’s to exponential growth, bold visions, and making 2025 your most transformative year yet.
Warmly,
Vishen
P.S. Don’t just read this and move on. Make your learning time sacred, and let’s grow together in 2025. A great first step, open up your Google Calendar and block off two hours every week for 2025 to focus on learning. This will take you a few minutes but this simple first step will change your life.
