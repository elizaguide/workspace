Transcript:
if your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve you're now in part two of our program everything that you learned so far if you were to take the Silva seminar would have been delivered to you in eight hours on the first day now we're going to the content that was typically delivered on the second day so these seminars typically happened on a Saturday and a Sunday you finish Saturday stretched out over almost two weeks if you decided to stretch it out that way some of you may have done it in one shot over one or two days that's great too but now we come to part two of the seminar part two is about refinement but before I get there let me tell you and summarize what you've learned so far first you've learned the different brainwave States you've learned how to access Altered States of mind starting with Alpha going deeper to Theta you've even learned through the mental video technique to access the elusive Delta frequency and how to apply it to doing more in solving problems in life you've learned how to project your awareness across time and space to gather information that might otherwise be unknown to you so you can make better decisions in life and speaking of decisions you've learned how to apply the mental video technique to solve situations that seem too difficult for you to solve on your own you've learned how to access higher intelligence to help you resolve these difficult situations and for smaller day-to-day scenarios you've learned how to apply the three scenes technique so all of these have given you a powerful toolkit to access alternate states of being so you can truly relax you can tap into creativity and you've learned these two powerful tools the mental video technique and the three scenes technique that is going to fundamentally change the way you show up in life so what we're going to do today is show you how to refine the results that you're getting from these me Jose Silva said that to apply the mental video or the three scenes technique in your life they are three ingredients that you need to have he call these ingredients desire belief and expectancy d b e desire means having a true burning desire for the outcome or for that problem to be resolved belief means believing that it can be resolved believing that it is in the field of human possibility and expectancy is the best one expectancy is where you are so confident that it's going to be resolved that you basically just expect it to happen when you bridge all of these together remarkable things start to happen today we're going to focus on the first ingredient desire and in our next lesson we'll focus on belief and expectancy just encapsulated in this beautiful quote by Napoleon Hill when it comes to desire it's important to cultivate a burning desire for the outcome that you're seeking to cultivate a burning desire means to not flip-flop on what you want think about this if your mind is truly bringing you everything it's focused on think about how often we flip-flop and confuse the mind we might decide that we want to have a vacation in the Bahamas but then a few weeks later we read about bad weather there maybe there were some strong winds and we go you know maybe it's not too sick maybe I want to have a vacation in Thailand instead as we flip our minds this way what happens is what is often coming towards this moves away think about this scenario you're in a restaurant and you show up and you ask the waiter for a menu and the waiter gives you a menu and says these are all the amazing things you can order today and you tell the way that you know I think I'd like to have some pizza so the way to say no problem I'm gonna go talk to the chef we'll be coming back with your pizza the way to rush is off and talks to the chef the chef goes wonderful we're gonna make the pizza he starts making the dough he starts putting on the pasta and the mozzarella and then out back in the restaurant you call the waiter again and you say waiter you know actually I'm feeling kind of full maybe really what I want is tomato soup the way that goes no problem Gonna Cancel the pizza Gonna Get You tomato soup he goes again to talk to the chef the chef goes no worries tossing the dough aside let me make some tomato soup and you call the waiter again waiter you know maybe not tomato soup maybe I'll just have some spaghetti something light and the way it goes no worries done with the tomato soup he goes back to tell the chef the chef pours out the tomato soup and starts boiling spaghetti now think about that scenario and how absurd it is no one would go to a restaurant and and be flip-flopping on their orders that much that we do that in life think about the scenario in the fall way your order is your desire it's your goal the waiter is your subconscious the chef is your higher intelligence or your higher power or God or whatever is bringing to you your burning desire think about how often you change the order that you put out for the goals in your life and think about what this might be doing remember when we are attempting to manifest something there is a Time Gap there needs to be a time Gap otherwise every thought instantly will manifest you think elephant and boo you're crushed by a giant elephant the time Gap according to philosophers like Esther Hicks gives you the opportunity to refine but many of us rather than refine our desire rather than decide all right we're going to go to the Bahamas and maybe I want to have this type of hotel and this type of travel Adventure we completely flip our desire we change our mind over and over and over again so the trick to burning desire is to think carefully about what you want to write it down to put it on a board and to focus on that thing and make it clearer and clearer and clearer and to stay with it this is what it means to have burning desire when you have burning desire you are motivated to wake up every day and practice the three scenes technique you are motivated to fine-tune your mental video technique You're motivated to think and dream about the object or the outcome that you want to attract in your life a few years ago I was teaching a silver class in New York and the wonderful lady came to me and she said Vision can you teach me to apply the three seams technique to become a better typist and I said well that's a strange request why would you want to be a better typist and she said well I'm a data entry Clerk and I get paid by the hour based on the number of data cards I get to produce now keep in mind this was 2005 so the way data entry worked was quite different from the way it works today so this wonderful data entry type is said can I use the three scenes technique to speed up my rate of typing out these cards and I said well yes you can but let me ask you a question why do you want to be a foster typist so she explained to me that the more form she could fill out the more she would get paid so I said great let's ask the next question why do you want to get paid more she said well I want to get paid more because I want to grow my savings and I said great why do you want to grow your savings she goes I want to grow my savings because I want to move to a new home in Brooklyn I said great why do you want to move to a new home in Brooklyn and that's when the true desire came out she said look Vision my mom lives in Detroit and Detroit is a really run down City it's ranked bottom 50 out of the 50 biggest cities in America and Detroit isn't safe and I worry about my mom because she lives by herself I want to move to this beautiful apartment so my mom can come and move with me I asked her the follow-up question that's wonderful now you're getting somewhere why do you want your mom to move in with you and she go well my mom and I we have this beautiful Legacy and family that goes all the way back to the Civil War and when you enter our apartment in Detroit it's filled with so many mementos and antiques I want to move all of this with my mom live in this beautiful new apartment in Brooklyn and decorate this apartment with all our family heirloom because I want to be a mother someday and when my daughter grows up I want her to remember her family Legacy and I said Bingo that's exactly it that's your true desire now tell me again did you really want to waste all your time trying to be a faster typist so you see when you understand your true desire the desire that comes after asking yourself why do I want this so I can get that so I can get that so I can get that it is on the last so it's on the picture you paint that really lights you up that is your true desire and that is what you want to focus on that is what you want to apply the mental video or the 3cs technique two and when you do that what you will find is that the outcome you are seeking will come to you much faster maybe for this young lady it wasn't about being a typist maybe there might be other opportunities other jobs maybe even her own business that might arise to get her to that ideal scenario with the apartment and her mother and the family Aloo you must seek your end goal that is an important thing now if you pay attention to that typist all the other stuff she was talking about in between the faster typist the bigger paycheck the higher savings those are means goals they are a mean to an end the end goal was that beautiful Vision that when she spoke about it totally led her up you want to identify your end goals and before we are done today I'm going to teach you a technique to do now let's go back to desire for a moment so the first rule of Desire is to know the difference between means goals the mean to an end and the end goal it is the end goal that you really want to focus on now the second rule of Desire is to know the difference between wanting and immature wanting this concept comes from Mindvalley author Michael that quick the spiritual teacher at the Agape spiritual center so Michael Beck would say something extremely similar to Jose Silva he says that so many of us have what he calls immature one it's wanting based on what the world is telling us we need and often these goals are not really the goals of your soul they are the goals of your politicians media advertising the culture Escape their goals that tells you that you must have two cars and a garage that you must get married and have 2.5 kids and own your own home there's nothing wrong with that but many of these goals are coming because we are blindly following what Society is telling us to do in reality true wanting is when you listen to your soul true wanting is when you paint a picture that is arising from the desires emerging from within you when you practice the mental video technique and you ask for a problem to be resolved with help from higher intelligence that is true wanting it is the compass pointing you in the right direction the Mexican author and contemporary of Jose Silva explained it to me this way I sat down with Don Miguel Ruiz once and I asked him Don what does the word tall tech mean your books like Mastery of Love talk about tall Tech wisdom and don't make algory's said Vision to be a tall tech mean to be an artist a politics or artist the problem with so many people is they do not paint a masterpiece for their own life rather they go through like a human photocopy machine they decide that they want this and this and this but these are nothing more than photocopies of other people's lives you want to be the artist of your own life that is what is meant to be a tall Tech you want to paint the most beautiful picture you can you want to decide where the Red's going where the yellow goes and where you're going to put the whites and the blacks you want to decide what this picture is going to look like and you want to make it unique to you so by becoming an artist of your own life you are avoiding in the 12 wanted and going to True wanting that is the key so now I want to teach you a technique to help you identify your true desires or your true wants because the better you identify your true desires the more you're going to be lit up about them the more you're going to be obsessed with thinking about them and focusing on them and the more you're going to start to believe faster they're going to come to you so to identify your true desires the technique I'm going to teach you is called the three most important questions now if you've been a mind-valley student for a long time you've probably done this technique I invented this technique in 2012 and it took off all around the world the American management association tweeted it to all its members it's been done by close to a million people at this point including in high schools in India or in Mexico and in large corporations and the three most important questions technique is really simple you're going to ask yourself three questions and the entire technique will take no more than nine minutes I'm gonna play for you a simple video that helps you understand this technique I release this video on social media a few months back and watching this simple short video will help you understand the nuances of this technique I'm then going to guide you into this exercise we're gonna do a fast streamline version of it and this is going to take only six minutes what you will need is a paper and a journal so watch this video and you'll be hearing from me soon foreign goal the question remains how do you make sure you're pursuing the Right End goals well I found that these three questions help all end goals fall into three categories and when you ask yourself these three important questions you end up identifying the Right End goals for you in each category the model is really simple the first category is experiences let me tell you why C.S Lewis said you do not have a soul you are a soul what you have is a body what this applies is that we are souls here having a human experience and one of the most beautiful things about this Human Experience it's things such as falling in love traveling to a new city creating something new doing those things that create that heart pounding feeling of joy and happiness these are beautiful end goal categories that you want to put on your three most important questions sheet now the second category is growth really it's asking yourself to have all of these beautiful experiences from the travel to the people I want to meet to the the environments I want to live in who do I have to be who is that man or woman I have to evolve into and this is where you start listing how you want to grow I think one of the things that we are here to do is to grow ourselves as human beings so in this category you ask yourself how do I want to grow in terms of my skills in terms of my career in terms of my abilities how do I want to take care of my body so I have great energy and I'm able to do things even as I get older how do I cultivate and grow my mind so that I can enjoy all of the amazing opportunities here on planet Earth growth is that second category then we go to the third category the third category is contribution I once heard the Dalai Lama say this if you want to be happy learn to make people happy and this is really what contribution is about if you believe we're all on this planet together why not help each other grow help each other have beautiful experiences and the way we do this is through the third category contribution contribution is where you make a list of how you want to give to your family to your community to the company you work for that's a company that's contributing in a good way to the world your contribution could be a blog post you write that inspires people it could be volunteer work it could be a work of art that beautifies the planet there are many ways to contribute but I think we all agree that contribution is one of the surest thoughts to happiness interestingly in Tony Robbins hit Ted Talk which is one of the most watched TED Talks ever he talks about how all of us have two great spiritual needs right the need to grow and the need to contribute he says if you aren't growing if you aren't contributing then you might be happy but you will never be fulfilled so again the three most important questions are what beautiful human experiences do I want to feel in my life how do I want to grow as a human being and how do I want to contribute and you can see how each leads them to the other so here's how The Exercise Works you take out a piece of paper you're going to make three columns on the paper and I'm going to take you through a timed Journey where you're going to write down your answers to the three questions I'm going to ask you before we get there I'd like to share with you just a brief glimpse of why this exercise is so important now something mysterious happens when you start putting down your goals and your Visions on the three most important questions sheet very often what I've seen is that situations opportunities emerge in people's lives that allow them to check off multiple items on their sheet one one person I'm proud to talk about is Ronan Diego so Ronan sheet looks something like that and if you were to look at the sheet and the items are highlighted see you could see that this is a man who really loves inspiring others and having a healthy body and learning about health interestingly about a few months after Roland's sheet he ended up taking part in the Viper challenge a really grueling race with 20 000 other competitors Ronan ended up coming out number one and through that not only did he help develop this this body of his dreams this Fitness level that he's always aspired to but inspiring others to do the same Jason Campbell is another friend of mine on his sheet when I looked at it I could see that there was a lot of ideas on the sheet about becoming a world-class speaker being a team Builder a manager teaching entrepreneurship and sales so Jason one day happened to be an a-fest and a major speaker who had to speak felt sick and all of a sudden we had a 20-minute slot on stage and no speaker now I knew Jason was a good speaker but I didn't know if he was AFS level but he came to me and said Vision I promise you put me on that stage and Magic will happen and something in my gut said trust him I put Jason on stage and he was voted best speaker he checked off a large number of items and his three most important questions and also got to speak about sales and Entrepreneurship and really Inspire the crowd limit was a blogger who worked at mine Valley her three most important questions were a lot about in firing others being a personal growth teacher even being an author strangely luminata wallet mind Valley wrote a blog post called 15 things to give up to be happy nothing happened for the first couple of months but about six months later a group of people started sharing that on Facebook and it took off within a few months it became the single most shared personal growth article in the history of Facebook with 1.2 million people sharing this on their timeline luminita got an offer from Penguin Books and her book is now out she managed to strike off multiple ideas of the three most important questions from inspiring others to being a personal growth teacher to writing a book to being author Amir Ahmad joined mind Valley as a 22 year old he was an intern when he joined me at our team Retreat and did this exercise and I guess being young he had no idea just what his limitations were so he put down some pretty fancy things he wanted a best-selling book he wanted to speak at ivy league universities he wanted to be on television four years later Amir was 26. he wrote a book called my Islam how fundamentalism stole my mind and doubt freed my soul it was about how the digital Revolution was shaking up the Middle East amir's book ended up being selected by foreign policy magazine as one of the top 25 must read books of 2013. and therefore he knew it Amir was being invited to speak at ivy league universities sharing the stage at the Oslo Freedom Forum being on television shows being invited to speak at companies like Google he became well known in his theme because of that book all of these people whether it was Fitness or becoming an author or speaking on stage attained incredible things in their life a lot of it started with a dream in their head a vision for a life based on what were their end goals and goals that really really feel them and made them happy and this is what you're going to experience as well well one of the best things about this exercise is that it works beautifully in groups at Mindvalley all our employees do the exercise the three most important questions and then we take everyone's sheep and we stick it on a giant wall so people can go to this wall look at other people's goals and figure out how can we help each other we try to create a culture where as much as possible individuals are not just chasing their own end goals but helping other people attain theirs too one example is Mariana Mariana wanted to hike in Nepal she went to a giant wall of three most important questions she saw others who had written down Nepal on their sheep connected with them and together four people ended up on a beautiful hike in Nepal for seven days it was one of the most beautiful moments of their life and all of them got to strike off multiple items of their three most important questions but see there is no Monopoly on dreams it's beautiful to be able to come up with ideas for your three most important questions and then to share these ideas with people or to see other people's sheets and when you see something you like you can go aha I want to add that too there is no Monopoly on dreams so whether it's schools or it's within your organization there are so many ways you can use the three most important questions to help not just cloth the Beautiful Life for yourself but help others create their beautiful life it's a beautiful exercise not just for the individual but for teens for schools for groups great so I hope you got the point of that video now here's what I want you to do take out a piece of paper and draw two lines on the paper so your paper is basically going to have 3D columns the First Column is going to say experience it the second column is going to say group and the third column is going to say contribution so the three things that truly light us up this human being I experience this every spiritual philosopher says that we are souls having a human experience so we can experience this planet in the best way possible so in the first question you're simply going to make a list of all the experiences you want in your life here are examples of experiences you might want it could be something like skydiving it could be doing a three-week trip across Europe with a loved one it could be becoming a mom or a dad and waking up and being able to hold your baby in your arms it could be starting a business and taking on that incredible world where you have to deliver a beautiful product of service to the world it could be writing a book or it could be painting a picture it could be the experience of falling in love these are all examples experiences that speak right to your soul now in the second column you're going to make a list of how you want to grow and you're going to tie it to the First Column you're going to ask yourself to be the man or woman with all of these amazing experiences how do I need to grow so for example if you put down that you want to have the experience of traveling across Europe with your loved one well how much you need to vote maybe you want to study the basics of a European language maybe you want to save up a little so you can spend three weeks traveling across Europe ask yourself how do I need to grow to be the man or woman who can have this list of experiences when you're done with that column you're going to go to the third column and the third column is contribution You're simply going to ask yourself if I were the man or woman with all of these experiences who has grown in this remarkable way how then can I contribute to the world remember Jose Silva's message of thinking about contribution ask yourself how can I give back to other people how can I be a better leader how can I volunteer my time maybe my money now when it comes to contribution it's not just about starting a social cause or donating to a charity your work could be a contribution you could be working at an incredible company releasing a good product to the world the work you do there is a form of contribution contribution can also come from setting a desire to be a better mom or a better dad or a better uncle or a better son you choose you're going to make a list of how you're going to contribute at this point I want you to pull out a piece of paper and I'm going to give you six minutes to do this exercise if you've done this exercise before you can skip this and if you want to go further in the three most important questions know that there are tons of resources out there on the web I deliberately release this technique on the web so as many people as possible to get access to it so if you have free time and you want to go deeper just Google three most important questions fiction now let's get started with your list we're going to start with the First Column experiences I'm going to give you two minutes write down as fast as you can the experiences that you seek to have in this life and remember this tip Jose Silva says that often what is coming from our soul feels like a gas and it happens fast don't overthink this the first thoughts that come to you are often the right and most accurate thoughts now we'll go to the second column growth I'm going to give you two minutes write down as it emerges all the ways you seek to grow again now foreign foreign foreign now we're going to go to contribution write down in two minutes all the ways you feel a calling to contribute to the world finish the three most important questions and you should have a piece of paper that looks something like this we love this exercise so much that across our office in mind Valley every single person does this exercise and we stick everyone's 3M IQ on a giant pin board you can do this exercise with your teams as well imagine how powerful it is when you and your team or your family know each other's deepest desires think about how you can contribute to other people so this is a really great exercise that you can introduce not just in your life but in the lives of the company you work for and even within your family I suggest you take this piece of paper and you stick it on your wall and every single day as you're practicing the three scenes technique or the mental video technique you pick an item from this list and you go deep and focus on it that's it for today's lesson I'll see you tomorrow foreign
