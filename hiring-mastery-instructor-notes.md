## Section 1: The Foundation - Why Most Hiring Fails (10 minutes)

### Key Point
85% of people worldwide hate their jobs because most companies hire for skills instead of values and growth orientation.

### Teaching Moment
**"Here's what most companies get wrong: They focus on what someone can DO instead of who they ARE and what they WANT to become."**

### Story to Share
- Traditional hiring: 100 résumés → pick best skills → hope for cultural fit
- Result: High turnover, disengaged employees, toxic culture

### Student Activity
Quick poll: "How many of you have ever felt misaligned with a job?" (Most hands will go up)

## Section 2: The Mindvalley Selective Hiring Process (15 minutes)

### Core Statistics to Emphasize
- **"For a typical position we sift through one hundred résumés and interview at least ten people"**
- This isn't inefficiency - it's intentional selectivity
- **"'A' people attract 'A' people"** - quality compounds

### The Non-Negotiable Screening Criteria
**💡 KEY INSIGHT:** "100 percent of our employees have spent significant time volunteering or working for nonprofits"

#### Why This Matters:
1. **Values alignment** - They already work for something bigger than money
2. **Growth mindset** - Volunteers are naturally transformational 
3. **Service orientation** - They understand the mission-driven approach
4. **Community focus** - They think beyond individual success

### Teaching Point
**"We don't just hire for what they can do for us. We hire for who they want to become and how we can serve their transformation."**

## Section 3: The Job Quadrant Framework - THE CORE (20 minutes)

### Background Story
Share how Vishen discovered this during his interview process and how it aligns perfectly with Maslow's hierarchy.

### The Four Quadrants

| **Job Quadrant** | **Maslow Level** | **What It Really Means** | **Red Flags** |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Friendship** | Connection & Belonging | Seeks meaningful relationships at work | "I work alone," antisocial tendencies |
| **Abundance** | Self-Esteem | Wants respect and recognition (*not just money*) | "Money is everything," no intrinsic motivation |
| **Growth** | Self-Actualization | Committed to personal development | "I'm fine as I am," fixed mindset |
| **Meaning** | Self-Transcendence | Wants to contribute to something bigger | "It's just a job," transactional thinking |

### 💎 CRITICAL INSIGHT TO EMPHASIZE
**"Abundance was never about money. Rather it was about the respect that people felt money gave them. The money was a means goal."**

#### How to Use This in Interviews:
**The Key Question:** *"What matters most to you in a job - is it the mission, personal growth, financial security, or the relationships you'll build?"*

### Ideal Candidates Choose:
1. **Growth + Meaning** (Perfect fit - naturally transformational)
2. **Friendship + Growth** (Great fit - will thrive in collaborative culture)
3. **Meaning + Abundance** (Good fit - mission-driven but needs recognition)

### Red Flag Combinations:
- **Abundance only** (Money-focused, likely to job-hop)
- **Friendship + Abundance** (Social but transactional)
- **No clear preference** (Lacks self-awareness)

### 🎯 INSTRUCTOR TIP
Role-play this with students. Have them interview each other using the Job Quadrant and identify the candidate's primary motivations.

## Section 4: The 3MIQ Process for New Hires (15 minutes)

### What is 3MIQ?
**Three Most Important Questions** - A framework where new employees define their personal dreams and goals.

### The Implementation Process:
1. **During onboarding:** All new hires complete their 3MIQ
2. **Public sharing:** Posted on bulletin board for team visibility  
3. **Manager access:** Copies shared with direct managers
4. **CEO connection:** Vishen keeps photos of every employee's 3MIQ on his phone
5. **Regular check-ins:** Used in one-on-one meetings and career development

### The Power of 3MIQ:
- **Visibility beyond the façade:** See who they really are
- **Team bonding:** When everyone knows each other's 3MIQs, deeper connections form
- **Career development:** Leaders can support employees' personal dreams
- **Retention:** People stay longer when they feel seen and supported

### Success Story to Share:
**Luminita Saviuc** - Joined as customer support agent from Romania. Her 3MIQ included "become a published author and speak internationally." While at Mindvalley, she wrote "15 Things to Give Up to Be Happy" which went viral (1.2M Facebook shares), leading to a Penguin Random House book deal.

### 🎯 INSTRUCTOR TIP
Have students create their own 3MIQ during class. This makes the concept tangible and helps them understand its power.

## Section 5: Employee Transformation Philosophy (10 minutes)

### The Mindvalley Difference
**"People join Mindvalley and get younger, fitter, happier, and healthier."**

### How Job Quadrant Drives This:
- **Growth-oriented candidates** naturally embrace development opportunities
- **Meaning-seekers** find purpose in the company mission
- **Friendship-focused** people create supportive peer networks
- **Abundance-minded** (properly understood) celebrate collective success

### The Result:
- Won "Healthiest Employer" award based on insurance data
- Team scores significantly above average on well-being metrics
- Inc. Magazine's Top 10 Most Beautiful Offices in the World
- 60 countries represented (people relocate to work there)

### Key Teaching Point:
**"When you hire for transformation potential instead of just current skills, you create a workplace where people don't just work - they evolve."**

## Section 6: Putting It All Together (15 minutes)

### The Complete Hiring System:

#### 1. **Attraction Phase**
- Create manifesto that speaks to values (not just job skills)
- Emphasize mission, growth opportunities, and community
- Screen for nonprofit/volunteer experience

#### 2. **Selection Phase**  
- Review 100 résumés, interview 10+ candidates minimum
- Use Job Quadrant framework to assess motivations
- Look for Growth + Meaning combinations

#### 3. **Onboarding Phase**
- Implement 3MIQ process immediately
- Leader one-on-ones to discuss personal dreams
- Connect individual goals to company mission

#### 4. **Development Phase**
- Regular 3MIQ check-ins and support
- Co-visioning (company invested in employee's personal vision)
- Create opportunities for growth in all four quadrants

### The Compound Effect:
**"'A' people attract 'A' people"** - When you hire transformationally-minded individuals, they naturally attract similar candidates, creating a self-reinforcing culture.

## Wrap-Up & Action Items (10 minutes)

### Student Takeaways:
1. **Implement Job Quadrant questions** in next hiring process
2. **Create 3MIQ process** for current and new team members  
3. **Audit current job postings** - do they speak to values or just skills?
4. **Screen for service orientation** (nonprofit/volunteer experience)

### The Big Picture:
**"When work fulfills dreams and dreams drive work, you don't have employees - you have co-creators of transformation."**
