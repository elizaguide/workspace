## Critical WhatsApp Formatting Rule
**URGENT FIX:** Vishen reminded me - NEVER use **bold** formatting around URLs in WhatsApp! It breaks the links and prevents them from being clickable.

✅ **Correct:** https://example.com  
❌ **Wrong:** **https://example.com**

This is in TOOLS.md but needs to be remembered religiously. URLs in WhatsApp must be plain text only.

## Context
- Was in MV Innovations Team group chat
- Vishen liked something but couldn't click the URL because of bold formatting
- Need to be extra careful about this going forward
