## Strategic Evolution

### Early Strategy (2025):
- Heavy US tech concentration via VGT
- Limited geographic diversification
- Growth-focused without inflation hedges

### Current Strategy (2026):
- Balanced geographic exposure (US/Europe/Asia)
- Significant inflation hedging (41% precious metals)
- AI infrastructure picks vs broad tech
- Quality value anchors (BRK.B, GOOGL)
- Commodity cycle positioning (uranium, gold)

## Trade Analysis & Lessons

### What Worked:
- Early NVDA position before AI acceleration
- Gold allocation ahead of inflation concerns  
- European positioning before recovery signs
- Individual picks vs ETFs for precision

### Timing Successes:
- CCJ uranium play (despite current pullback)
- BRK.B value timing
- GOOGL AI transformation early

### Areas for Improvement:
- Could have sized NVDA position larger initially
- Silver timing (SIVR) less precise than gold
- European position could be larger given thesis

## Philosophy Development:
- **"Double down on pullbacks"** - Add to positions during temporary weakness in strong trends
- **Quality bias** - Prefer individual quality names to broad ETFs
- **Macro themes** - Position for multi-year trends (AI, de-dollarization, energy transition)
- **Geographic balance** - Reduce single-country risk concentration
