## Group Context
- WhatsApp group 120363423218272168@g.us = **Mar Tech Group** (Marketing Technology team at Mindvalley)
- Participants include team members working on marketing technology issues

## Today's Issues Handled
- **Sangita Kanoria Access Issue:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - Customer: sangitakanoria@hotmail.com  
  - Slack User ID: U07Q6RHQWRF
  - Issue: Needed access to Social Media Mastery program
  - **Resolution:** Tom confirmed access was already fixed on Feb 3 - customer has access now
  - Action taken: Emailed Tom (tom@mindvalley.com) and Alex (alex@mindvalley.com) with customer details
  - Follow-up reminder cancelled (issue was pre-resolved)

## Email Chain Corrections
- Initial email: Mistakenly thought it was internal Slack ownership issue
- Correction 1: Clarified it's customer access issue, suggested direct contact
- Correction 2: Said DON'T contact customer, handle backend only
- Final correction: Tom CAN contact customer directly - approved by Vishen

## Major Technical Breakthrough
- **Smart Video Transcript System:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - 100x efficiency improvement over video download approach
  - 3/10 videos successfully processed and indexed in RAG system
  - System now deployed and operational
  - Significant impact on content processing capabilities

## Session Compaction
- Conversation history compacted due to context limits
- Pre-compaction memory flush executed to preserve critical information
- Cross-session context maintained through memory files

## Mindvalley Design System - CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED
- **Fixed New Summit Model webpage:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Applied proper Mindvalley branding with mindvalley-font.css
  - Used Google Sans Flex typography with proper title/body classes
  - Brand colors: #7a12d4 for actions only, #0f131a for text
  - White/light gray backgrounds, no purple gradients
  - Mobile-responsive mv-container structure

## 🚨 PREVENTION SYSTEM CREATED
- **Updated TOOLS.md:** Made design system check mandatory FIRST step
- **Created WEB-CHECKLIST.md:** Systematic process to prevent design system skips
- **Memory trigger:** Before any HTML write → Check if mindvalley-design skill needed
- **Hard rule:** ANY webpage for Vishen/teams = MUST use mindvalley-design skill first

## The Mistake Pattern Identified
❌ **What happened:** Jumped straight to HTML coding without checking design requirements
✅ **Prevention:** ALWAYS ask "Is this Mindvalley-related?" before writing ANY HTML
✅ **New workflow:** Question → mindvalley-design skill → Implementation

## Lessons Learned
- Always clarify if an issue is internal/technical vs customer-facing
- Confirm communication approach (direct contact vs backend fix) before acting
- This Mar Tech group handles customer access and technical integration issues
- Major technical achievements should be immediately documented for cross-session continuity
- **CRITICAL:** Must use mindvalley-design skill for ALL Mindvalley-branded pages (TOOLS.md mandate)
