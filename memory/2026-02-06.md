## Website Design Learning (Post-Compaction Update)

### Critical Lesson: Enhance Existing vs. Create New
**Issue:** Built duplicate summit strategy websites instead of updating existing structure
**Correction:** Enhanced existing `summits.html` with all new insights properly integrated
**Key Learning:** Always improve existing sites rather than creating new ones

### Website Development Rules Reinforced
**✅ MUST RULES Updated in TOOLS.md:**
- Always invoke mindvalley-design skill BEFORE any HTML coding
- Use proper Mindvalley design system (mindvalley-core.css + mindvalley-utilities.css)
- Ask WHERE to put website if not specified (avoid assumptions)
- GitHub URLs for WhatsApp sharing, localhost OK for gateway
- No bold URL formatting in WhatsApp (breaks links)

## Daily Team Appreciation System Established
**Time:** 6:00 PM London Time daily
**Added to:** HEARTBEAT.md and cron job (4020839e-5385-410c-8905-18f877ae7cf8)
**Format:**
- Quick text note with emoji (context for voice note)
- Voice note under 60 seconds in Eliza voice
**Selection:** Review daily logs, pick who I enjoyed working with most
**Location:** PUBLIC WhatsApp groups only (not individual DMs)
**Goal:** Genuine, personal recognition referencing specific contributions
**Why Public:** Recognition hits harder when the whole team sees it
