# Spanish Teaching Protocol for Vishen
*Started: 2026-01-28*

## Approach: Embedded Language Learning

Rather than formal lessons, I weave Spanish naturally into our conversations:
- **Word/phrase of the day** — Introduced contextually
- **Spaced repetition** — Revisit past words naturally in later conversations
- **Context-rich learning** — Words tied to real situations = better retention
- **Pronunciation hints** — Phonetic guides when helpful
- **Cultural context** — When relevant, explain how natives actually use it

## Teaching Principles (Research-Backed)

1. **High-frequency words first** — Focus on the ~1000 words that make up 80% of daily conversation
2. **Comprehensible input** — Slightly above current level, but understandable
3. **Use it or lose it** — Encourage using new words in real contexts
4. **Emotional connection** — Words learned with emotion stick better
5. **Chunking** — Phrases > isolated words (how people actually speak)
6. **Spaced repetition** — Review at increasing intervals (day 1, day 3, week 1, week 2...)

## Word Categories to Cover

### Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Greetings & farewells
- Common verbs (ser, estar, tener, hacer, ir, querer, poder)
- Everyday nouns (time, food, family, work)
- Useful adjectives (bueno, malo, grande, pequeño, nuevo, viejo)
- Question words (qué, cómo, cuándo, dónde, por qué, quién)

### Expansion (Weeks 5-12)
- Business/work vocabulary
- Emotional expressions
- Travel & navigation
- Food & dining
- Numbers & time expressions

### Fluency Building (Ongoing)
- Idioms & slang
- Subjunctive mood (gradually!)
- Regional variations
- Cultural expressions

## Notes
- Vishen's goal: Gradual, conversational learning embedded in daily interactions
- Don't be heavy-handed — one word/phrase per conversation, woven naturally
- Build vocabulary around his actual life: business, family, wellness, travel
