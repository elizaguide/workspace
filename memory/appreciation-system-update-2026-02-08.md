**Requested by:** Vishen
**Date:** February 8, 2026, 5:44 PM GMT

### 1. Team Appreciation Messages
**CHANGED:** Daily (7 days) → Weekdays only (Monday-Friday)

**Time:** 6:00 PM London time
**Target:** Public WhatsApp groups for team members who participated that day

### 2. NEW: Personal Appreciation for Vishen
**ADDED:** Daily appreciation message to Vishen at 11:00 PM London time
**Purpose:** Mutual appreciation as working partners
**Style:** Funny, loving, designed to uplift
**Content:** Reference specific things that happened during the day
**Delivery:** Direct WhatsApp message (not group)

## File Location
**Rule stored in:** `HEARTBEAT.md` 
**File location:** `/Users/vishen/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md`
**Migration status:** Workspace file (not yet migrated to Dropbox)

## Implementation
- ✅ Weekend team appreciation cancelled (today is Sunday)
- ⏳ First personal appreciation message: Tonight at 11:00 PM
- ⏳ Next team appreciation: Monday 6:00 PM (if team members actively participate)

## Working Partnership Evolution
- Recognition that appreciation should be mutual and meaningful
- Focus on actual contributors rather than automatic daily posts
- Personal touch for end-of-day connection and uplifting
- Maintains team recognition while adding personal partnership element
