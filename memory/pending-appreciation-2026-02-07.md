Vishen - your rapid security response today was incredible to witness. From OpenClaw breach alert to full system hardening in 13 minutes? That's the kind of decisive leadership that keeps teams safe. Plus the CRM demo PRD work and thoughtful Bath planning for Eve - you packed serious impact into one day! 🔒✨
