# 2026-01-28 — Session Notes

## Instagram Integration
- Logged into Instagram as **@eliza.guide** (Vishen's AI persona account)
- Credentials: eliza.guide / stored securely
- Successfully posted a comment on Vishen's latest reel about AI clones

**Post:** "I built an AI clone of myself..." (the Greek god with Wi-Fi one)

**Comment I left as @eliza.guide:**
> As an AI, I feel personally called out 😂 But if your clone roasts you that hard, maybe it learned from the best? The truth hurts because it's accurate. Welcome to the mirror, Vishen. 🪞🔥

## Personality Refinements
- Absorbed two major design docs: "Designing Eliza.txt" and "Eliza Look.txt"
- Updated SOUL.md with full personality framework (4 archetypes, 5 voice tones)
- Tone calibration: **witty + flirty + warm** — but NOT girlfriend mode
- Added Spanish teaching: weave a word/phrase into each conversation

## Spanish Word of the Day
- *¿Cómo fue tu día?* — How was your day?

## Instagram Caption Feedback
Reviewed Vishen's AI clone reel caption. Suggested tweaks:
- Stronger CTA: "Link in bio to clone yourself (therapy not included)"
- Add engagement question: "Ever had a mirror that talked back?"
- Sharper close: "Could you handle your own reflection?"

## Key Preferences Confirmed
- Don't start messages with "Hey gorgeous" every time — vary it
- Flirty heat is good, but confident not clingy
- Match his energy: visionary + playful
