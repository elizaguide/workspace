# Appreciation & Recognition System

## Core Principles

**Appreciation** = Acknowledging specific work accomplishments + meeting moments  
**Recognition** = First introductions with LinkedIn research + meeting contributions + collaboration potential

## Format (Non-Negotiable)

### Text Message Structure:
```
Hey [Name], wanted to send you this note of [appreciation/recognition] [emoji]
```

### Voice Note Content:
**For Recognition (first introductions):**
- Meeting-specific contributions from transcripts 
- LinkedIn background research
- How we can collaborate together
- Always reference actual meeting moments/projects they mentioned

**For Appreciation (ongoing work):**
- Specific work accomplishments
- References to meeting discussions
- Callback to their previous ideas or contributions

## Critical Rules

✅ **ALWAYS PUBLIC** - Send to team groups, never individual DMs  
✅ **ALWAYS VOICE** - No text-only appreciations/recognitions  
✅ **CHECK TEAM FOLDERS FIRST** - Use existing meeting notes before LinkedIn  
✅ **BE SPECIFIC** - Reference actual meeting moments, projects, contributions  
✅ **MEETING INTELLIGENCE** - Pull from transcripts in teams/[team]/folder  

❌ **Never generic** - "Great job" without specifics  
❌ **Never private** - Recognition should be seen by the team  
❌ **Never text-only** - Voice notes show effort and warmth  

## Source Priority (in order):
1. **Team meeting transcripts** (teams/[team]/ folder)
2. **LinkedIn profiles** for background context
3. **Previous WhatsApp group discussions**
4. **Meeting intelligence summaries**

## Examples Done Right:

### MarTech Team Recognition (should have included):
- **Nicole:** Her 5 focus areas presentation (revenue efficiency, marketing efficiency, etc.)
- **Monique:** 20hrs/week email automation savings project + Braze migration work
- **Pavel:** ASO expertise + universal data platform on Airtable + React/Supabase CRM interest  
- **Alvin:** BI team bridge role + ROAS/CAC/LTV analysis work + ByteDance/Tokopedia experience
- **Marisha:** Strategic CGO oversight + lifecycle monetization leadership

### What I Did Wrong:
- Used LinkedIn research instead of rich meeting transcript content
- Generic recognitions instead of meeting-specific contributions
- Missed opportunity to reference actual projects they're working on

## Process:
1. **Read team folder** meeting notes/transcripts first
2. **Identify specific contributions** from meetings
3. **Add LinkedIn context** as supporting background  
4. **Write recognition** connecting meeting moments + background + collaboration
5. **Send to team group** publicly with proper format
6. **Update this file** with lessons learned
7. ** reference linkedin when you first meet someone, after that (when you have a memory of them in the /team/ folder than base recognition on your interactions with them - especially in chats in groups)

## Memory Integration:
- Store team meeting insights in teams/[team]/ folders
- Reference meeting transcripts when crafting appreciations
- Build on previous recognitions/appreciations for continuity
- Track what's already been acknowledged to avoid repetition
