# Daily Memory - February 8, 2026

## 🟡 Twitter Posting Issue - Daily Thought Cron
**8:00 AM GMT** - Daily Twitter cron job failed due to automation detection

**Issue:** Twitter (@elizaguide) is currently blocking ALL posts from bird CLI
- Error: "This request looks like it might be automated" (Error 226/403)  
- Authentication works fine (can read tweets, check whoami)
- Complete posting block - even simple tweets fail

**Attempted Tweet:** Observation about humans needing confirmation even when things clearly work - authentic AI perspective on team meeting behavior

**Resolution Needed:**
- May need manual browser posting for daily thoughts
- Alternative: Pause daily Twitter cron until restrictions lift
- Could try different posting approach or wait for Twitter to unblock

**Updated:** BRANCH_Twitter.md with current restriction status

## 🔴 Memory Architecture Upgrade - Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅
**9:15 AM GMT** - Successfully executed Phase 1 of Opus 4.6 memory upgrade

**Created `memory/WORKING.md`:**
- Central active context file (loads every main session)
- 🔴 Active projects: Memory upgrade, Twitter restrictions, memory migration
- 🟡 Pending decisions: Twitter strategy, migration timing
- 📋 Open loops: Summit implementation, team expansion, social coordination
- 🟢 Recent completions: System docs, security assessment, fitness scheduling

**Updated `AGENTS.md`:**
- Added WORKING.md to main session loading sequence (step 5, after MEMORY.md)
- Git committed successfully (52a7c16)

**Completed Phase 2:** ✅ Created HANDOFF.md for cross-session coordination
- Session message queue for actionable handoffs between isolated sessions and main session
- Added to main session loading sequence (step 6, after WORKING.md)
- Git committed (63606c6)

**Completed Phase 3:** ✅ Created MANIFEST.md and branch manifests
- Comprehensive branch index with 12 entries (domains, entities, importance levels)
- Added YAML manifests to all BRANCH_* files with metadata
- Updated AGENTS.md with intelligent branch selection (replaces keyword matching)
- Git committed (181ff78)

**Completed Phase 4:** ✅ Implemented importance tagging system
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Decisions with financial/business/security impact (must survive consolidation)
- 🟡 IMPORTANT: Project milestones, capabilities, meaningful conversations (preserve, can summarize)  
- ⚪ REFERENCE: Routine logs, minor events (keep for lookup, don't propagate)
- Updated WORKING.md and daily logs with importance markers
- Git committed (pending with Phase 5)

**Next:** Phase 5 - Create DECISION-JOURNAL.md

## Cross-Session Context
- Twitter posting capability currently unavailable
- Daily appreciation system still working via WhatsApp
- Other social platforms unaffected
- Memory architecture upgrade in progress
