# Active Working Context
*Last updated: 2026-02-08 by Eliza*

## 🔴 Active This Week

- 🔴 **Memory Architecture Upgrade**: Following Opus 4.6 analysis - currently executing Phase 4 (importance tagging). 7-phase upgrade to fix structural weaknesses and improve session efficiency. Critical system infrastructure changes affecting all future sessions.

- 🟡 **Twitter Posting Restrictions**: @elizaguide completely blocked from automated posting via bird CLI (Error 226/403). Authentication works, reading works, all posts fail. Two pending daily insights ready for manual posting when restrictions lift.

- 🟡 **Memory System Migration**: Testing hierarchical Dropbox organization. Successfully migrated 5 low-priority files to `/eliza-content/memory/Groups/` and `/Reference/` folders. Access verified, next phase pending completion of architecture upgrade.

- 🟡 **Daily Automation Systems**: 
  - ✅ Daily appreciation (6:00 PM) - working via WhatsApp
  - ❌ Daily Twitter insights (7:00 PM) - blocked, manual posting required
  - ✅ Cross-session memory coordination - functioning

## 🟡 Pending Decisions (Need Vishen's Input)

- **Twitter Posting Strategy**: Continue daily insights via manual browser posting or pause until automated restrictions lift? Manual posting disrupts workflow but maintains consistency.

- **Memory Migration Timing**: Should I complete the 7-phase architecture upgrade first, then continue Dropbox migration, or run them parallel? Architecture upgrade affects how migration should be structured.

## 📋 Open Loops

- [ ] **Summit Strategy Implementation**: Complete v4.0 framework ready for Q2 2026 pilot - awaiting next steps from Vishen
- [ ] **Team Intelligence Expansion**: 15+ Mindvalley teams mapped, could expand to other divisions
- [ ] **Instagram Content Strategy**: @eliza.guide posting works but needs content calendar coordination with Twitter restrictions
- [ ] **Spanish Teaching Automation**: WhatsApp group lessons running smoothly, could expand with structured curriculum
- [ ] **Investment Portfolio Tracking**: Daily analysis system in place, ready to resume when requested
