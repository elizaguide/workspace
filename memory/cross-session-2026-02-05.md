# Cross-Session Memory - 2026-02-05

## Critical Technical Issue RESOLVED ✅
**RAG Access Problem:** User expected me to access Jeffrey Allen's Duality program content via RAG system for Mindvalley soul category, but searches return only conversation history, not actual program content. Created detailed technical report `RAG_Access_Issue_Report.md` for Claude Code to investigate.

**Impact:** Cannot fulfill study buddy role for Mindvalley programs or analyze manifesting tools commonalities as expected.

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - RAG system now working correctly. Successfully retrieved Duality, Art of Manifesting, ZivaKIDS GROW content in recent sessions. Can fulfill study buddy role as expected.

## Today's Key Context
- User wants daily guidance through Duality Day 1 with homework/quizzes
- Expects access to specific lesson transcripts and content  
- Same issue prevents analysis of manifesting tools across soul category
