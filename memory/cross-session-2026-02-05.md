# Cross-Session Memory - 2026-02-05

## Critical Technical Issue RESOLVED ✅
**RAG Access Problem:** User expected me to access Jeffrey Allen's Duality program content via RAG system for Mindvalley soul category, but searches return only conversation history, not actual program content. Created detailed technical report `RAG_Access_Issue_Report.md` for Claude Code to investigate.

**Impact:** Cannot fulfill study buddy role for Mindvalley programs or analyze manifesting tools commonalities as expected.

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - RAG system now working correctly. Successfully retrieved Duality, Art of Manifesting, ZivaKIDS GROW content in recent sessions. Can fulfill study buddy role as expected.

## Today's Key Context
- User wants daily guidance through Duality Day 1 with homework/quizzes
- Expects access to specific lesson transcripts and content  
- Same issue prevents analysis of manifesting tools across soul category

## Completed Work ✅
**Integration Paradox Newsletter COMPLETE**
- Created comprehensive newsletter based on global sentiment analysis
- Design analysis page explaining strategic choices and reasoning  
- Both pages deployed to correct web repository with proper structure
- Newsletter URL: https://elizaguide.github.io/web/newsletters/2026-02-05-integration-paradox.html
- Analysis URL: https://elizaguide.github.io/web/newsletters/2026-02-05-integration-analysis.html
- Used emoji favicons (🧠 newsletter, 🔍 analysis)
- Cross-linked both pages for complete user experience
- Based on Jeffrey Allen & Regan Hillyer transcript insights via RAG system

**Executive Presentation FIXED**
- Fixed broken image paths for Eliza portrait (smile.PNG) and laugh image
- Fixed all audio file paths from audio/executive-presentation/ to audio/
- Added placeholder images for missing screenshots
- Presentation now loads properly: https://elizaguide.github.io/web/execs/feb-presentation/executive-presentation.html

## Action Items
- RAG system connectivity needs technical investigation ✅ RESOLVED
- May need different tool beyond memory_recall to access program content ✅ RESOLVED
- Consider testing with other soul category programs (Silva Ultramind, etc.)
