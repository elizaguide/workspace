**Previous Score:** 60/100 (DOWNGRADE of -15 points)  
**Trend:** 📉 DETERIORATING - Security posture has worsened

### 🚨 EMERGENCY ACTION ITEMS

#### IMMEDIATE (Within 4 Hours)
1. **🔴 CRITICAL:** Scan and remove ALL credentials from memory files
   - Estimated risk: HIGH credential exposure
   - Files affected: Multiple memory/*.md files
   
2. **🔴 CRITICAL:** Enable model sandboxing configuration
   - Current state: Complete bypass of containment
   - Impact: Full system access without restrictions

#### HIGH PRIORITY (Within 24 Hours)
3. **🟠 HIGH:** Review and restrict elevated tool access
   - Current state: Unrestricted command execution
   - Recommendation: Implement capability allowlists

4. **🟠 HIGH:** Audit environment file configurations

### 📊 Security Trend Analysis
```
2026-02-09: 60/100 (WARNING)
2026-02-11: 45/100 (CRITICAL) ↓ 15 points
```

**Deterioration Factors:**
- Credential exposure has increased
- New environment vulnerabilities detected
- Sandboxing configuration degraded

### 📞 Escalation Required
- **Norman briefing:** IMMEDIATE (score <50)
- **Emergency remediation:** 4-hour response window
- **Next assessment:** 24 hours to verify critical fixes
- **Full review:** 48 hours for complete remediation validation

---

## Historical Context
- **OpenClaw vulnerabilities:** Multiple attack vectors remain unpatched
- **Credential leaks:** Ongoing exposure in memory system
- **Sandboxing:** Core containment mechanism remains disabled
- **Access controls:** Only bright spot - user restrictions working

### Assessment Notes
- Score below critical threshold (50) triggers emergency protocol
- Downward trend indicates active security degradation
- Multiple critical vulnerabilities require immediate attention
- Norman notification and emergency timeline activation required
