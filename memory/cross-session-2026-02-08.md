# Cross-Session Memory - February 8, 2026

## Memory System Migration INITIATED ✅
**Started Hierarchical Memory Reorganization**
- **Objective:** Transition from flat BRANCH_* structure to hierarchical Dropbox organization
- **Location:** `/Users/vishen/Mindvalley Dropbox/Vishen Lakhiani/eliza-content/memory/`
- **Strategy:** Start with least important files to test system

**Successfully Migrated (Test Phase):**
- ✅ **Groups/Spanish-Training.md** (WhatsApp Spanish learning group context)
- ✅ **Groups/Vibrantly-Build.md** (Vibrantly team group context)  
- ✅ **Groups/MV-Advertising.md** (MV advertising team group context)
- ✅ **Reference/FATMASTER-STACK.md** (Supplement protocol for belly fat reduction)
- ✅ **Reference/transformation-mirror-reminder.md** (One-off reminder)

**New Structure Created:**
```
/eliza-content/memory/
├── Groups/          (WhatsApp group contexts) ✅
├── People/Teams/    (Team member info) ✅  
├── Projects/        (Project-specific memory) ✅
└── Reference/       (Static reference docs) ✅
```

**Access Test Results:**
- ✅ All files fully accessible from new Dropbox location
- ✅ Content integrity maintained during migration
- ✅ Dropbox sync functioning properly
- ✅ Ready for next migration phase

  - Security hardening post-OpenClaw breach
  - Personality system implementation (SOUL.md)
  - Automated task management (15+ cron jobs)
  - Multi-channel integration details
  - Performance metrics and KPIs
  - Development roadmap and optimization opportunities

**Secondary Document:** `ELIZA_MEMORY_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` (13,209 bytes)
- Focused specifically on memory architecture for initial analysis
- Technical implementation details and limitations
- Optimization recommendations

## Health Protocol Information Provided ✅
**Supplement Stack Documentation**
- **Accessed:** Complete current supplement protocol from `VISHEN_HEALTH_PROFILE.md`
- **Provided:** Full 24+ supplement daily regimen with timing and purposes
