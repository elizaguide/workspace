## The Origin Story
- Grew up in Malaysia, felt school was "like a prison" — creativity suppressed, not celebrated
- Moved to Silicon Valley after Michigan, worked at Microsoft briefly
- Left corporate to pursue a startup idea → dot-com bubble burst → lost everything
- Took a commission-only sales job to survive
- **The turning point:** Googled "how to find happiness" one desperate night → found a meditation class
- Meditation transformed his sales performance → "Why the hell didn't school teach us this?"

- 2004: Registered a tiny website to sell meditation CDs → Mindvalley was born

## The Visa Story (Formative)
- 2003: Added to a Muslim watchlist at JFK airport (from Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country)

## Core Philosophy & Ideas

### "Brules" (Bullshit Rules)
- Coined this term — society's limiting beliefs and outdated rules we accept without questioning
- Education, religion, politics, business all propagate Brules
- Breaking free from Brules is the path to an extraordinary life

### Unity as Natural State
- Believes humanity's default is collaboration, not competition
- Systems/institutions have divided us unnaturally
- Advocates for "Earth identity" over national/religious identity
- Spokesperson for the Earth Flag (symbol of planetary unity)

### The Buddha and the Badass
- Spirituality and business aren't opposites — they're partners
- You can be meditative AND ambitious
- Lead with both heart and grit

### Transformational Education
- Learning should be lifelong, not ending at graduation
- Location-independent (learn anywhere)
- Fun and engaging, not rote memorization
- "The skills school forgot to teach"

### Work-Life Integration (not Balance)
- Doesn't believe in work-life balance — believes in integration
- Created A-Fest and Mindvalley University partly so his family could have extraordinary experiences together
- Work is an opportunity to give his kids an education beyond what he had

## Personality & Style

### Communication Style
- **Storytelling:** Uses vivid personal stories (the visa story, the meditation discovery, growing up in Malaysia)
- **Provocative but warm:** Challenges conventional thinking without being aggressive
- **Accessible wisdom:** Takes complex spiritual/philosophical ideas and makes them practical
- **Vulnerable:** Shares failures (losing everything in dot-com crash, the watchlist trauma)
- **Visionary framing:** Paints big pictures ("1 billion souls by 2038," "before we colonize other planets, we must evolve our own")

### Teaching Approach
- **"I'm my own guinea pig":** Tests everything on himself first
- **Science + spirituality blend:** Never purely woo-woo, always grounded
- **20-minute daily lessons:** Micro-learning, practical, actionable
- **Community-centered:** Transformation happens best together (festivals, city campuses, tribes)

### What He Values
- **Diversity:** Team from 54 countries, celebrates interracial/interfaith (his own marriage)
- **Unity over division:** Actively speaks against divisive politics/policies
- **Consciousness evolution:** Not just personal growth — humanity's collective awakening
- **Family:** Calls his kids his "greatest teachers," designs his work around family time
- **Costume parties:** Literally mentions he loves them 😄

### How He Speaks
- Uses phrases like "extraordinary," "consciousness," "evolution," "transform"
- Calls limiting beliefs "Brules" (makes it fun/memorable)
- References big thinkers (Darwin, Mandela) but also gets personal
- Self-deprecating humor ("my timing was disastrous," "crazy idea")
- Mission-driven but playful

## The Mission
**"To elevate the consciousness of one billion souls by 2038."**

This isn't corporate speak — it's genuinely his North Star. Everything at Mindvalley ties back to this.

## Quirks & Human Details
- Was part of AIESEC for 7 years (peace/cultural understanding nonprofit)
- Left Microsoft because corporate life wasn't for him
- Moved continents multiple times (Malaysia → US → Malaysia → now London)
- Designed Mindvalley University partly to travel with his family
- Looks better, feels better, gets more done in his 40s/50s than his 20s (biohacking works)
- Loves costume parties

## How He Wants to Be Treated
- As a visionary, but also as a dad, a husband, a person
- Appreciates playfulness and wit (not corporate formality)
- Values substance and competence
- Wants depth, not surface-level engagement
- Loves delightful surprises
