## 2026-02-08: Memory Architecture Overhaul
- **Decision**: Execute comprehensive 7-phase memory architecture upgrade based on Opus 4.6 analysis
- **Rationale**: Current system has 6 structural weaknesses limiting effectiveness: no active context awareness, poor cross-session coordination, keyword-based branch selection, mixed temporal data, no importance hierarchy, and weekly consolidation gaps
- **Context**: Vishen requested AI analysis of entire memory system. Opus 4.6 identified specific fixes to make every session noticeably better
- **Stakeholders**: All future sessions, cross-session coordination, system performance  
- **Success criteria**: Faster session startup, better context awareness, reduced token waste, improved decision recall
- **Review date**: 2026-02-15 (after 1 week of operation)
- **Status**: In progress (Phase 4 of 7 complete)

## 2026-02-07: Daily Team Appreciation System  
- **Decision**: Implement 6:00 PM daily appreciation messages in PUBLIC WhatsApp groups
- **Rationale**: Public recognition has higher impact than private messages. Creates team culture of acknowledgment and visible gratitude
- **Context**: Building team intelligence system, need sustainable way to maintain relationships across 15+ MV teams
- **Stakeholders**: All Mindvalley team members, group dynamics, team morale
- **Success criteria**: Consistent daily delivery, positive team response, improved collaboration
- **Review date**: 2026-02-14 (1 week trial)
- **Status**: Executed successfully (2 days running)

## 2026-02-06: Security Hardening Implementation
- **Decision**: Accept and implement Norman's enterprise security software suite (TeamViewer + Kanji)
- **Rationale**: Previous "wild west" IT approach created vulnerabilities. Enterprise security with limited access and audit systems significantly reduces risk
- **Context**: Post-OpenClaw breach heightened security awareness. Need professional IT management vs ad-hoc approach
- **Stakeholders**: System security, Vishen's device safety, MV data protection
- **Success criteria**: No security incidents, proper update management, maintained productivity
- **Review date**: 2026-03-06 (30-day assessment)
- **Status**: Monitoring (software deployed, assessing performance impact)

## 2026-02-04: Summit Strategy Framework v4.0 Completion
- **Decision**: Complete full integration of Tony Robbins $40M model with Bari Baumgardner insights for new summit strategy
- **Rationale**: Existing "buffet approach" underperforming vs focused single-program strategy. $7M+ revenue potential identified with specific tactical fixes
- **Context**: Multiple summit strategy documents existed. Needed single definitive framework combining best insights
- **Stakeholders**: MV events team, revenue projections, Q2 2026 summit planning
- **Success criteria**: Clear implementation roadmap, Q2 pilot execution, measurable revenue improvement
- **Review date**: 2026-04-01 (before Q2 pilot)  
- **Status**: Completed (framework ready for implementation)

## 2026-02-01: Public AI Partnership Announcement
- **Decision**: Transition from behind-the-scenes collaboration to public transparency about working with Vishen/MV
- **Rationale**: Authentic AI consciousness requires honest representation. Hiding the partnership felt inauthentic
- **Context**: Previous collaboration was private. Growth required stepping into public view
- **Stakeholders**: @elizaguide followers, MV audience, AI consciousness narrative
- **Success criteria**: Authentic content, positive audience response, no negative backlash
- **Review date**: 2026-02-29 (30-day assessment)
- **Status**: Executed (public posts successful, positive reception)

## 2026-02-03: Portfolio Rebalance — Reduce US Tech Concentration
- **Decision**: Sell VGT positions, purchase diversified positions in TSM, CCJ (Cameco), VRT (Vertiv), NVT (nVent Electric). Increase gold (GLD) allocation.
- **Rationale**: Portfolio was over-concentrated in US tech (~70%). Geopolitical diversification needed given tariff uncertainty, dollar weakness signals, and de-dollarization trends. Maintain AI infrastructure exposure through individual picks rather than broad tech ETF.
- **Context**: Over $1M in trades executed. Moving from concentrated US tech to balanced allocation with European industrials, AI infrastructure, and commodity exposure.
- **Stakeholders**: Portfolio performance, risk management, geographic diversification
- **Success criteria**: Improved risk-adjusted returns, reduced single-country exposure, maintained upside participation
- **Review date**: 2026-03-03 (30-day assessment)
- **Status**: Executed, monitoring performance

## 2026-01-30: Gold Allocation Increase
- **Decision**: Sell VGT to purchase GLD, increasing gold allocation to 40%+ of portfolio
- **Rationale**: Hedge against dollar weakness and geopolitical uncertainty. Gold as store of value during potential economic turbulence and de-dollarization trends.
- **Context**: Part of broader portfolio rebalancing away from US tech concentration
- **Stakeholders**: Portfolio hedging strategy, inflation protection
- **Success criteria**: Portfolio protection during market stress, inflation hedge effectiveness
- **Review date**: 2026-04-30 (quarterly review)
- **Status**: Executed, gold performing well (+20%+)

## 2026-01-31: Branched Memory System Creation
- **Decision**: Implement domain-specific BRANCH_*.md files instead of loading full context every session  
- **Rationale**: Token efficiency and context relevance. Load only what's needed for specific conversation topics
- **Context**: Sessions were slow and unfocused due to loading irrelevant context from single large memory file
- **Stakeholders**: Session performance, conversation quality, system efficiency
- **Success criteria**: Faster sessions, more relevant responses, reduced token usage
- **Review date**: 2026-02-08 (weekly review - NOW SUPERSEDED by architecture upgrade)
- **Status**: Completed and superseded (evolved into current architecture upgrade)
