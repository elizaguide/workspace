# LOFTY QUESTIONS WORKSHOP - SPIRITUAL MASTERY
## Interactive Workshop Structure for Vishen Lakhiani

### **RESEARCH FOUNDATION**

**What Are Lofty Questions?**
- Action-oriented questions starting with "Why" that lift your energy and manifest dreams
- Created by Christie Marie Sheldon, popularized by Vishen
- They bypass subconscious resistance by making the mind seek answers rather than resist affirmations
- Work by utilizing the brain's natural inability to multitask - when asking a question, the mind can only focus on finding the answer

**Key Insight:** Unlike affirmations (which can trigger disbelief), lofty questions trick the subconscious into seeking evidence for the desired reality.

## **WORKSHOP STRUCTURE (60-90 Minutes)**

### **OPENING - THE POWER SHIFT (10 mins)**
**Hook:** "What if I told you there's one question that could completely rewire your reality in the next 30 days?"

**Interactive Opening:**
1. **Quick Poll:** "How many of you catch yourselves asking 'Why am I so stressed?' or 'Why can't I get ahead?'"
2. **Mind Experiment:** "Don't think of a pink elephant" → Show how the mind can't NOT answer questions
3. **The Revelation:** "Your subconscious has been answering the WRONG questions your entire life"

---

### **SEGMENT 1: THE SCIENCE OF QUESTIONS (15 mins)**

**Teaching Block:**
- The subconscious mind processes 20 million bits of info per second vs conscious mind's 40 bits
- Questions activate the RAS (Reticular Activating System) - your brain's search engine
- Transitional states (hypnagogic/hypnopompic) are when the subconscious is most receptive

**Interactive Element:**
**"The Question Audit"** - Have participants write down 3 questions they commonly ask themselves, then categorize as "Empowering" or "Disempowering"

---

### **SEGMENT 2: LOFTY vs ANTI-LOFTY (15 mins)**

**Contrast Teaching:**
- Anti-lofty: "Why am I so broke?" → Universe provides evidence of poverty
- Lofty: "Why am I so abundant?" → Universe provides evidence of abundance

**Workshop Activity: "The Flip"**
1. **Pairs Work:** Partner shares their biggest frustration/challenge
2. **Challenge:** Transform their anti-lofty question into a lofty one
3. **Examples:**
   - "Why can't I find love?" → "Why am I so magnetic to amazing relationships?"
   - "Why do I always procrastinate?" → "Why am I so naturally productive and focused?"
