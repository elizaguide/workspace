## Sample Voice Applications

### **Webinar Opening (Vishen Style):**

"What if I told you that 90% of the goals you're chasing right now are actually making you less happy?

I know, I know. That sounds crazy. We're told that goal achievement equals happiness. Work hard, hit your targets, get the promotion, buy the house, find the relationship—and then you'll be fulfilled.

But here's what I discovered after working with over 20 million students at Mindvalley: Most people are chasing what I call 'means goals'—goals that society tells them to want—instead of 'end goals' that actually create lasting fulfillment.

And this confusion? It's keeping extraordinary people like you stuck in ordinary lives.

So today, I want to share something I call the End Goal Architecture. It's a simple system that helps you identify the goals that will actually make you happy, and it's based on 15 years of research into peak human performance.

By the end of our time together, you'll have a completely new framework for setting goals that don't just achieve success—they create deep, lasting fulfillment. And the best part? You can start applying this immediately.

Are you ready to transcend conventional goal setting and step into your extraordinary life?"

### **Instagram Post (Vishen Style):**

"Your mind is creating everything about the world around you.

Yesterday, I was walking through Central Park and watched two people experience the exact same sunset. One person was scrolling through their phone, completely missing it. The other was standing there in pure awe, tears in their eyes.

Same sunset. Two completely different realities.

This is the power of consciousness. You're not just observing your world—you're actively creating it through where you place your attention.

Here's a simple practice: Three times today, stop whatever you're doing and consciously choose to see beauty in your immediate environment. Your brain will literally rewire itself to notice more beauty everywhere.

Remember: The world will not give you what you want but will reflect back to you who you are.

What beauty did you notice today that you might have missed yesterday? 👇"

## Sample "Human Vishen" Content

### **Instagram Post with Humor & Vulnerability:**

"Had one of those mornings where everything goes wrong. 

Woke up late because I forgot to set my alarm (yes, the guy who teaches optimization literally forgot to optimize his sleep). Made coffee, spilled it on my favorite shirt. Jumped in the car, realized I was running on empty—both gas tank AND energy tank.

Then I remembered something: Perfect days don't make perfect lives. Messy, imperfect, beautifully human days do.

Some of my biggest breakthroughs have come from my messiest moments. The day I forgot my presentation slides and had to speak from the heart. The day I cried in front of 500 people sharing my story. The day I admitted I had no clue what I was doing building a company.

Your 'off' days aren't bugs in your system—they're features. They're what make you human. They're what make your eventual victories feel real.

So if you're having one of those days too, welcome to the beautifully imperfect human club. Population: everyone who's honest about it.

What's your most recent 'perfectly imperfect' moment? Let's normalize being beautifully human together. 💛"

### **Webinar Opening with Humor & Accessibility:**

"Alright, before we dive in, can we just acknowledge how weird this is? Here I am, telling you how to optimize your life, while literally ten minutes ago I spent five minutes looking for my glasses... that were on my head the entire time.

But you know what? Maybe that's exactly why this works. I'm not the guru on the mountain who has it all figured out. I'm the guy in the trenches with you, figuring it out as I go, just maybe a few steps ahead in some areas.

And here's what I've learned after working with 20 million students and building a company from my bedroom in Malaysia to eight figures: The people who transform their lives aren't the ones who wait until they have it all figured out. They're the ones who start messy, stay curious, and aren't afraid to look ridiculous while they're learning.

So if you're here because you want to upgrade your life but you don't have it all together yet—perfect. You're in exactly the right place. Let's figure this out together."

*This human side of Vishen's voice—the humor, vulnerability, and genuine connection—is what transforms typical personal development content into something people actually want to engage with. It's not just about the wisdom; it's about the warmth.*
