# Script in Vishen's Teaching Voice

Stop trying to be spiritual. The world does not need more spiritual people.

You know what the world needs? People who actually get things done.

Somewhere along the way, spirituality became a performance. People chasing enlightenment while avoiding responsibility. They spend hours meditating, talking about alignment, waiting for the universe to deliver—but they never actually move.

And this isn't growth. This is what I call spiritual procrastination.

Here's the thing: The spirituality we should seek shows up in motion. When you're building, creating, solving problems, leading people—and still staying conscious while doing it.

It's not about escaping the world; it's about elevating how you operate inside it.

So meditate, yes. But then go build the company. Launch the idea. Have the hard conversation. Fix the system.

Bring your consciousness into the chaos.

Because the goal isn't to be spiritual. The goal is to be awake while you change the world.

Do you agree?
