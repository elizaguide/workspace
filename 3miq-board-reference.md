# 3MIQ Board Reference

## For the Instructor Notes Section

When teaching about the 3MIQ Process, you mentioned wanting to **"add a picture of the 3MIQ board"**.

### Suggested Implementation:

In the slides or during the lesson, show a visual of the 3MIQ bulletin board where employees post their Three Most Important Questions.

### Visual Description for Creation:
- **Cork board or whiteboard** with colorful sticky notes or index cards
- **Each card contains:**
  - Employee name
  - Their 3 most important questions/goals
  - Colorful, handwritten or printed format
- **Diverse representation** showing the global team (60 countries)
- **Mix of personal and professional goals** visible on different cards

### Example 3MIQ Cards to Show:
```
[Card 1 - "Maria, Design Team"]
1. Launch my own pottery business
2. Speak at 3 design conferences this year  
3. Learn conversational Portuguese

[Card 2 - "James, Engineering"] 
1. Complete my pilot's license
2. Mentor 5 junior developers
3. Build an AI app for mental health

[Card 3 - "Priya, Marketing"]
1. Write a book about sustainable living
2. Run a marathon in every continent
3. Create scholarship for underprivileged students
```

### Photo Location Suggestion:
- Take a photo of your actual Mindvalley 3MIQ board in the office
- Or create a mockup using the examples above
- Insert in **Section 4** of the instructor notes
- Also add to **Slide 6** of the presentation

This visual will make the 3MIQ concept immediately tangible for students and show how personal dreams integrate with professional environments.
