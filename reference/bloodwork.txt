Cortisol (R)
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
Cortisol (R) 343 nmol/L 123-626 (AM)
46.2-389 (PM)
Sample Type :Serum
Method : ECLIA
Comments -
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
In healthy individuals cortisol secretion follows a diurnal pattern .The level at 8.00PM is normally 50% of the level at 8.00AM. Random cortisol
determinations are not very helpful. 80-90% of cortisol is carried in blood bound to corticosteroid binding globulin. 5-7% bound loosely to albumin,
and the remainder unbound. Loss of diurnal variation in Cushings syndrome.
INTERFERENCE:
Increased secretion is seen in hypoglycemia, stress, narcosis, pregnancy, obesity, depression and hyperthyroidism. Decreased secretion can be
seen in hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, hepatitis. Cortisol secretion does not change with age. In pregnancy there is a progressive rise.
RECOMMENDATION:
Recommended blood samples to be drawn at 8.00AM and at 4.00PM due to diurnal variations of cortisol hormone.

Bicarbonate
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
Bicarbonate 29 mmol/L 22-30
Sample Type :Serum
Method : PEP (Phosphoenolpyruvate)
Comments -
Clinical Implication:
1) The bicarbonate content of serum or plasma in a significant indicator of electrolyte dispersion and anion deficit. Together with pH determination,
bicarbonate measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous potentially serious disorders associated with acid-base imbalance
in the respiratory and metabolic systems. Some of these conditions are diarrhea, real tubular acidosis, carbonic anhydrase inhbitors, hyperkalemic
acidosis, renal failure, and ketoacidosis.
2) Alterations of bicarbonate (HCO3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in plasma are characteristic of acid-base imbalance. The nature of the
imbalance cannot, however, be inferred from the bicarbonate value itself, and the determination of bicarbonate is rarely ordered alone. Its value has
significance in the context of other electrolytes determined with it and in screening for electrolyte imbalance.

Lipase, Serum
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
Lipase Serum 118.8 U/L 23-300
Sample Type :Serum
Method : Enzymatic with colipase-VITROS
Interpretation -
In pancreatitis, lipase becomes elevated at about the same time as amylase (4-8 hours). But lipase may rise to a greater extent and remain
elevated much longer (7-10 days) than amylase. In acute pancreatitis, normoamylasemia may occur in up to 20% of patients, hence both enzymes
should be assayed.

FERRITIN, SERUM
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
FERRITIN SERUM 220 ng/mL 12-300
Sample Type :Serum
Method : CLIA
Interpretation -
Serum ferritin concentration is a very sensitive and early indicator of iron deficiency that is uncomplicated by other concurrent disease, idiopathic
hemochromatosis, and transfusion siderosis.
Serum ferritin levels decrease with iron deficiency associated with generalized malnutrition but remain normal in the presence of inflammation
associated with iron deficiency. The combination of ferritin and transferrin levels is therefore useful in differentiating thesedisorders.

Comments -
AST levels are usually elevated before clinical signs and symptoms of disease appear. Five- to 10-fold elevations of both AST and ALT occur in
patients with primary or metastatic carcinoma of the liver, with AST usually being higher than ALT, but levels are often normal in the early stages of
malignant infiltration of the liver. Elevations of ALT activity persist longer than do those of AST activity. Elevated AST values may also be seen in
disorders affecting the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney.

Interpretation -
A complete cholesterol test includes the calculation of four types of fats in your blood:
Total cholesterol. This is a sum of your blood's cholesterol content.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is called the "bad" cholesterol. Too much of it in your blood causes the buildup of fatty deposits
(plaques) in your arteries (atherosclerosis), which reduces blood flow. These plaques sometimes rupture and can lead to a heart attack or stroke.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This is called the "good" cholesterol because it helps carry away LDL cholesterol, thus keeping arteries
open and your blood flowing more freely.
Triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. When you eat, your body converts calories it doesn't need into triglycerides, which are
stored in fat cells. High triglyceride levels are associated with several factors, including being overweight, eating too many sweets or drinking too
much alcohol, smoking, being sedentary, or having diabetes with elevated blood sugar levels.

VITAMIN B12
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
VITAMIN B12 843 pg/mL 197-771
Sample Type :Serum
Method : ECLIA
Interpretation -
Vitamin B12 deficiency frequently causes macrocytic anemia, glossitis, peripheral neuropathy, weakness, hyperreflexia, ataxia, loss of
proprioception, poor coordination, and affective behavioral changes. These manifestations may occur in any combination; many patients have the
neurologic defects without macrocytic anemia.
Vitamin B12 deficiency may be due to lack of IF secretion by gastric mucosa (eg, gastrectomy, gastric atrophy) or intestinal malabsorption (eg, ileal
resection, small intestinal diseases). Pernicious anemia is a macrocytic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency that is due to a lack of IF
secretion by gastric mucosa.
Comments -
Serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels are also elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency states

(Aged 20-49)-4.56-28.2
(Aged >50)-2.49-21.6
Female :
Menstrual cycles-0.198-2.67
Sample Type :Serum
Method : ECLIA
Test Comment : RECHECKED
Interpretation -
Testosterone production in testes and ovaries is regulated via pituitary-gonadal feedback involving luteinizing hormone (LH) and, to a lesser degree,
inhibins and activins. Most circulating testosterone is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which, in men, also is called testosterone-
binding globulin. A lesser fraction is albumin bound and a small proportion exists as free hormone. Historically, only free testosterone was thought
to be the biologically active component. However, testosterone is weakly bound to serum albumin and dissociates freely in the capillary bed,
thereby becoming readily available for tissue uptake. All non-SHBG-bound testosterone is therefore considered bioavailable.
During childhood, excessive production of testosterone induces premature puberty in boys and masculinization in girls. In women, excess
testosterone production results in varying degrees of virilization, including hirsutism, acne, oligo-amenorrhea, or infertility. Mild-to-moderate
testosterone elevations are usually asymptomatic in male patients but can cause distressing symptoms in female patients. The exact causes for
mild-to-moderate elevations in testosterone often remain obscure. Common causes of pronounced elevations of testosterone include genetic
conditions (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia); adrenal, testicular, and ovarian tumors; and abuse of testosterone or gonadotrophins by athletes. 
Decreased testosterone in female patients causes subtle symptoms. These may include some decline in libido and nonspecific mood changes. In
male patients, it results in partial or complete degrees of hypogonadism. This is characterized by changes in male secondary sexual characteristics
and reproductive function. The cause is either primary or secondary/tertiary (pituitary/hypothalamic) testicular failure. In men, there also is a gradual
modest but progressive decline in testosterone production starting between the fourth and sixth decades of life. Since this is associated with a
simultaneous increase of SHBG levels, bioavailable testosterone may decline more significantly than apparent total testosterone, causing
nonspecific symptoms similar to those observed in testosterone deficient women. However, severe hypogonadism, consequent to aging alone, is
rare.

Anti Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (Anti CCP)
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
Anti CCP 0.5 U/ml Negative:<17.0
Positive:>/=17.0
Sample Type :Serum
Method : CLIA
Interpretation -
Useful for evaluating patients suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In differentiating RA from other inflammatory arthritis or connective
tissue diseases.
A positive result for cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies may be suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) if compatible clinical features of
disease are present.
Significantly elevated levels of CCP antibodies may be useful to identify RA patients with erosive joint disease.
Comments -
Positive results for cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies may occur in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or other
autoimmune, connective tissue diseases.
Antirheumatic therapy should not be initiated based solely on a positive test for CCP antibodies, and changes in treatment should not be based
upon the levels of CCP antibodies.

ZINC
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
ZINC 79.5 µg/dL 72.6-127
Sample Type :Serum
Method : End Point, Vitros
Interpretation -
Useful for Detecting zinc deficiency.
Zinc is an essential element; it is a critical cofactor for carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase, RNA and DNA polymerases, alcohol
dehydrogenase, and many other physiologically important proteins. The peptidases, kinases, and phosphorylases are most sensitive to zinc
depletion. Zinc is a key element required for active wound healing.
Comments -
Burn patients with acrodermatitis may have zinc levels as low as 40 mcg/dL; these patients respond quickly to zinc supplementation.
An elevated serum zinc concentration is of minimal clinical interest.

SEX HORMONE BINDING GLOBULIN (SHBG)
Investigation Result Units Biological Reference Interval
SHBG 66.9 nmol/L Males:
20-49 years : 18.0 - 53.4
>= 50 years : 18.0 - 134
>20 years : Not established
Females:
All ages : 28.3 - 134
Sample Type :Serum
Method : CLIA
Comments -
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), is the blood transport protein for testosterone and estradiol. Decreased SHBG serum concentrations are
associated with conditions in which elevated androgen concentrations are present, or the effect of androgen on its target organs is excessive.
Because of the high-binding affinity of SHBG to DHT, as compared to estradiol, SHBG has profound effects on the balance between bioavailable
androgens and estrogens. Increased SHBG concentrations may be associated with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism in men, while decreased
concentrations can result in androgenization in women. SHBG is regulated by insulin, and a low SHBG concentration often indicates insulin
resistance and, consequently, may be a predictor of type 2 diabetes.
USEFUL FOR :Diagnosis and follow-up of women with signs or symptoms of androgen excess (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome and idiopathic
hirsutism).An adjunct in monitoring sex-steroid and antiandrogen therapy. An adjunct in the diagnosis of disorders of puberty. An adjunct in the
diagnosis and follow-up of anorexia nervosa. An adjunct in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis (tissue marker of thyroid hormone excess). A possible
adjunct in diagnosis and follow-up of insulin resistance and cardiovascular and type 2 diabetes risk assessment, particularly in women.
