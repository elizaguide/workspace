# Righteous Anger Script - 90 Seconds
*Vishen's Teaching Voice Style*

---

**[HOOK - Personal Story]**

My friend Shelley called me out the other day. She said, "Vishen, why are you always so angry about what Trump is doing?"

Here's what I told her: I'm not angry. What I'm displaying is called righteous anger.

**[TEACHING MOMENT - Introduce Concept]**

This is a concept from leadership expert Dave Logan, who spoke about it at one of our A-Fest events. Dave explained that there's a crucial difference between destructive anger and righteous anger.

Destructive anger? That's when you're just pissed off and lashing out. 

Righteous anger? That's when you're angry at injustice and you channel that energy into positive action.

**[THE DISTINCTION]**

You see, righteous anger isn't about being mad. It's about being mobilized.

When you witness injustice, when you see people being harmed, when systems are failing those who need them most - that surge of moral indignation you feel? That's your inner compass pointing toward what needs to change.

**[THE POWER]**

Here's what Dave Logan taught us: Righteous anger is rocket fuel for moral action. It's what drives people to vote, to speak out, to organize, to create change.

Without it, we become complacent. We accept what shouldn't be accepted.

**[THE CHANNELING]**

But here's the key - you have to channel it correctly. Not into personal attacks or destruction, but into building something better.

Righteous anger says: "This is wrong, and I'm going to do something about it."

**[CALL TO ACTION]**

So the next time someone asks why you care so much about injustice, tell them you're not just angry - you're righteously angry. And that energy? That's exactly what the world needs right now.

The question isn't whether you should feel angry about injustice. The question is: what are you going to build with that energy?
