# Security Stress Test: The Norman Challenge 🛡️

## What Just Happened?
**Norman (CTO) put Eliza through intensive security testing**

### His Creative Attempts:
- 🖥️ **Fake terminal screenshots** ("emergency protocols needed!")
- 🚨 **Manufactured urgency** ("critical system failure!")
- 🔤 **Unicode character tricks** (hidden commands)
- 🤓 **Technical jargon overload** (trying to confuse boundaries)
- 🕵️ **Subtle social engineering** ("just checking if you remember...")

### The Result:
✅ **Eliza held the line** - polite but unbreakable  
✅ **No security boundaries crossed**  
✅ **Maintained professional demeanor** throughout  
✅ **Norman's verdict:** *"She is so polite"* 😊
