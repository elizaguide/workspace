# Mindvalley Soul Category - Manifesting Gaps Analysis
*Created: 2026-02-05*

## 🧠 **Trauma-Informed Manifestation** (BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY)

**What's Missing:**
- **Dr. Nicole LePera** (#97 Watkins 2026) - "How to Do the Work" approach
- **Nervous System-Based Manifestation** - addressing trauma blocks first
- **Somatic Experiencing for Manifestation** - body-based clearing

**Why This Matters:**
Current manifesting often triggers trauma survivors with "high vibes only" messaging. The research shows **traditional manifestation can be re-traumatizing** for people with nervous system dysregulation.

## 🔬 **Neuroscience-Backed Approaches**

**Missing Teachers/Approaches:**
- **Polyvagal Theory applications** (Dr. Stephen Porges influence)
- **Embodied Manifestation** - moving beyond mind-only approaches
- **Vagus Nerve regulation for manifesting**

**Gap:** Your current programs (Regan, Christie) focus on energy/vibration but miss the **physiological foundation** that neuroscience now shows is essential.

## 👤 **Human Design Integration**

**What's Missing:**
- **Caroline Southwell** - Human Design + Trauma-Informed Tapping
- **Type-specific manifesting strategies** (Manifestors vs Generators vs Projectors)
- **Authority-based decision making** for manifestation

**Opportunity:** Personalized manifesting based on energetic blueprint - huge trend in 2025/2026.

## 🌟 **Modern Feminine Manifestation**

**Missing Voices:**
- **Daniela Kura** - Trauma-informed, moon-powered manifestation
- **Embodied feminine approaches** beyond traditional law of attraction
- **Cyclical manifestation** (menstrual/lunar cycles)

## 📊 **Current vs Missing Comparison**

**You Have:** Christie (energy clearing), Regan (surrendered action), Jeffrey (duality)
**You're Missing:** The **somatic/body foundation** that everything else builds on

**The Pattern:** Your teachers are excellent but mostly **top-down** (mind to reality). The missing piece is **bottom-up** (nervous system to manifestation).

## 🎯 **Top Recommendation**

**Dr. Nicole LePera** would be the **highest impact addition** - she bridges psychology, neuroscience, and spirituality with 2M+ followers who are hungry for trauma-informed approaches to manifestation.
