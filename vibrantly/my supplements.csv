300-600mg (30 - 60min before exercise).  Studies show increased strenght and muscle fibre recruitment before gym. ",,,🧠 Nootropics / Cognitive,,,"Alpha-GPC overview
- A fast-absorbing choline donor that raises acetylcholine (focus, learning) and supports phosphatidylcholine (cell membranes). GeniusPure Alpha-GPC is the same core ingredient; synergies below apply regardless of brand. If the product is a 50% Alpha-GPC yield, adjust dose accordingly (e.g., 300 mg of 50% provides ~150 mg Alpha-GPC).

Best same-day synergies
- Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR): Provides acetyl groups to combine with choline for acetylcholine synthesis; supports mitochondrial energy. Typical: 500–1,000 mg with Alpha-GPC.
- Uridine monophosphate + DHA (omega-3) + B-vitamins (B6, B12, folate): Complements choline in the Kennedy pathway for membrane phospholipid/synapse support. Typical: uridine 150–250 mg, DHA 500–1,000 mg, standard B-complex.
- Phosphatidylserine (PS): Membrane fluidity and stress-axis support; pairs well with cholinergic support. Typical: 100–200 mg.
- L-tyrosine: Catecholamine precursor for focus under stress; complements cholinergic tone. Typical: 300–500 mg (NALT 250–350 mg).
- Caffeine + L-theanine: Alertness with smoother feel; plays well with Alpha-GPC for clean focus. Typical: caffeine 50–200 mg + theanine 100–200 mg.
- Rhodiola rosea (std. ~3% rosavins): Stress resilience and mental energy; can reduce mental fatigue. Typical: 200–400 mg early day.
- Lion’s mane (hericium erinaceus, fruiting body): Nerve growth factor support; long-term cognitive complement. Typical: 500–1,000 mg.
- Creatine monohydrate: Cellular energy and cognitive support (especially if low meat intake or sleep-deprived). Typical: 3–5 g daily.
- Magnesium (glycinate or L-threonate): Balances excitability and may help sleep if Alpha-GPC is stimulating. Typical: 200–400 mg in the evening.

Pre-workout angle
- Alpha-GPC 300–600 mg 30–60 min pre-workout can aid power output; stacking with caffeine (and/or creatine, beta-alanine) is common for performance.

Combos to use cautiously or avoid
- Huperzine A or other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (galantamine, donepezil): Additive cholinergic effect—risk of headache, nausea, brain fog, insomnia; if used, keep doses low and infrequent.
- Doubling major choline sources (e.g., high-dose citicoline/CDP-choline or large dietary choline load) the same day can cause cholinergic side effects; titrate based on how you feel.
- Anticholinergic meds (diphenhydramine, some antihistamines) can blunt Alpha-GPC’s cognitive effects.

Simple stack examples (same-day)
- Focus/work day: Alpha-GPC 300–600 mg + ALCAR 500–1,000 mg + caffeine 50–150 mg + L-theanine 100–200 mg; optional L-tyrosine 300–500 mg.
- Long-term brain support: Alpha-GPC 300 mg + uridine 150–250 mg + DHA 1,000 mg + B-complex + PS 100 mg; optional lion’s mane 500–1,000 mg.
- Performance: Alpha-GPC 300–600 mg + caffeine 100–200 mg + creatine 3–5 g; optional beta-alanine 2–3 g.

Dosing/timing tips
- Typical Alpha-GPC: 300–600 mg once or twice daily; start low. Take earlier in the day if it affects sleep (can intensify dreams).
- If your product is 50% yield, double the capsule weight to estimate actual Alpha-GPC provided.
- Monitor for cholinergic signs (headache, jaw tension, nausea); reduce dose or avoid stacking with other cholinergics if they appear.

Safety notes
- Avoid if pregnant/breastfeeding or if on cholinesterase inhibitors unless medically supervised.
- If you take anticholinergic or cholinergic medications, consider potential interactions.
- Keep total daily choline intake reasonable to avoid side effects."

Neuropathy / nerve healing (your foot recovery): up to 600 mg 2× daily used in clinical trials",Alpha Lipoic Acid,🦶 Feet Injury,checked,,,"🔑 Core Benefits of ALA for You
1. Fat Loss & Glucose Control

ALA makes your cells more insulin sensitive → glucose goes into muscles (not fat).

Works like a natural “insulin mimetic,” similar to berberine but via different pathways.

✅ For you: helps with your extreme fat loss phase and prevents carb spillover into fat storage.

2. Mitochondrial Energy Production

Co-factor in the Krebs cycle → helps convert carbs, fats, proteins into ATP.

Synergizes with CoQ10 + L-Carnitine + Riboflavin, which are already in your stack.

✅ For you: more training energy, better muscle pump, less fatigue during workouts.

3. Antioxidant & Healing

ALA is both fat- and water-soluble → can cross cell membranes and the blood-brain barrier.

Recycles other antioxidants (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Glutathione).

Works with NAC + Selenium to raise glutathione peroxidase, which your TruHealth flagged as critically low.

✅ For you: improves recovery, skin health, and speeds up tissue healing (important for your feet).

4. Anti-Aging & Longevity

Improves mitochondrial function → reduces ROS (oxidative stress).

Supports healthy nerves → used in Europe for diabetic neuropathy and nerve pain.

✅ For you: helps with nerve repair post-foot surgery and prevents oxidative aging.

⚡ In Practice (for Vishen)

Morning with CoQ10 + Carnitine = 🔥 metabolism boost, ATP output for training.

Before carb meals (optional) = insulin sensitivity → less fat gain, more glycogen into muscles.

With NAC + Selenium = rebuilds glutathione → fixes your flagged low oxidative defense.

👉 So in simple terms:
ALA will make your fat loss cleaner, your workouts more energized, your recovery faster, and your antioxidant defenses stronger.

ChatGPT said:

Alright, Vishen — weighing your labs, goals, and stack, here’s how I’d rate Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) for you right now:

🔎 Why it matters for you

TruHealth flagged critically low glutathione peroxidase → ALA is one of the best ways to restore this defense (when paired with NAC + selenium).

You’re in rapid fat loss + muscle gain mode → ALA improves glucose disposal into muscle, keeping insulin sensitivity sharp.

You’re dealing with healing (feet) → ALA reduces oxidative stress, supports nerve repair, improves circulation.

It synergizes perfectly with CoQ10 + L-Carnitine + Riboflavin (which you already take).
Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a bit special in timing because it’s both water- and fat-soluble, and it competes with minerals for absorption. Here’s the breakdown for you:

⏰ Best Timing

Take on an empty stomach → 30–60 min before meals, or at least 2 hours after eating.

If you’re using it for blood sugar control / fat loss → take just before your carb-containing meals (ALA improves glucose uptake into muscles).

If using for antioxidant & mitochondria support → morning or early afternoon is best (synergizes with CoQ10, carnitine, riboflavin — all in your AM stack).

⚡ Synergies

Works very well with NAC + Selenium → boosts glutathione and antioxidant defense (exactly what your TruHealth flagged low).

Pairs with CoQ10 + L-Carnitine → enhances mitochondrial energy output.

Can be combined with Berberine at mealtime to further improve insulin sensitivity.

🚫 Avoid

Don’t take with high-dose minerals (magnesium, iron, zinc, calcium) → they block ALA absorption.

Don’t take too close to bedtime → in some people it’s mildly stimulating.

👉 For your goals (fat loss + mitochondria + feet healing), I’d recommend:

Morning, empty stomach, stacked with CoQ10 + Carnitine + Riboflavin.

Optional: before your largest carb meal if you’re using it primarily for insulin control.",50 mg oral ,,,🛡️ Antioxidants / Detox,"NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine),Selenium,Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10),Acetyl-L-Carnitine","iron,Zinc,Calcium,Magnesium (Generic)","Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and R-alpha-lipoic acid (R-ALA) pair well with the following on the same day:

- Acetyl‑L‑carnitine (ALCAR): Mitochondrial and nerve support; common combo. Typical: ALA 300–600 mg (or R‑ALA 100–300 mg) + ALCAR 500–1,500 mg, morning/early afternoon.
- NAC (± glycine): Boosts glutathione that ALA helps recycle. NAC 600–1,200 mg; glycine 1–3 g.
- Vitamins C and E: Antioxidant network synergy. Vitamin C 250–500 mg; vitamin E (mixed tocopherols) 100–200 IU.
- CoQ10 (ubiquinone/ubiquinol): Mitochondrial antioxidant/energy support. 100–200 mg.
- Chromium (e.g., picolinate): Insulin sensitivity complement. 200–1,000 mcg; monitor for low blood sugar if on glucose‑lowering meds.
- Biotin: Offsets potential uptake competition with ALA. 300–1,000 mcg (often taken a few hours apart from ALA).
- Thiamine/benfotiamine: Nerve and glucose metabolism support; especially if deficiency risk. Thiamine 50–100 mg or benfotiamine 150–300 mg 1–2×/day.
- Magnesium (e.g., glycinate): Metabolic and nerve function. 200–400 mg; take 3–4 hours away from ALA (ALA can chelate minerals).
- Omega‑3s (EPA/DHA): Cardiometabolic and anti‑inflammatory complement. 1–2 g EPA+DHA/day.
- Selenium: Supports glutathione peroxidase. 100–200 mcg/day (don’t exceed 200 mcg without guidance).
- Curcumin or resveratrol: Additional antioxidant/anti‑inflammatory and metabolic signaling support. Curcumin 500–1,000 mg with bioenhancer; resveratrol 100–200 mg.
- Taurine: Nerve and glucose support. 500–2,000 mg.
- Berberine: Strong glycemic synergy; 300–500 mg 2–3×/day; increased hypoglycemia risk when combined with ALA—monitor closely.

Use notes
- ALA/R‑ALA absorb best on an empty stomach; if it upsets your stomach, take with a small, low‑mineral snack.
- Separate ALA from mineral supplements (iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium) by 3–4 hours due to chelation.
- R‑ALA is the more bioactive isomer; stabilized forms (e.g., Na‑R‑ALA) improve absorption. Dose R‑ALA at ~50–60% of racemic ALA.
- Cautions: May lower blood glucose; monitor if you use diabetes meds/insulin or berberine. Use care with thyroid meds (space doses and monitor labs). Ensure adequate thiamine if alcohol use or deficiency risk. Not established in pregnancy/lactation."

- Citrus bergamot extract 500–1000 mg/day: supports LDL and non-HDL improvements.
- Curcumin 500–1000 mg/day (with a bioavailable form): anti-inflammatory, complements metabolic effects.
- Resveratrol 100–250 mg/day or quercetin 500–1000 mg/day: additional AMPK/SIRT1 activation and vascular support.
- Plant sterols/stanols 1.5–2 g/day: further LDL lowering.

Liver and gut support
- Silymarin (milk thistle) 150–300 mg/day: hepatoprotective; may also improve berberine absorption.
- N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) 600–1200 mg/day: supports liver and metabolic health.
- Probiotics 5–20B CFU/day and prebiotics (inulin, acacia): help gut balance and may reduce GI side effects; take away from berberine.

Absorption enhancers (optional; use with caution if on medications)
- Piperine 5–10 mg with berberine doses, or silymarin as above: may increase berberine bioavailability.

Simple same-day schedule (example)
- Breakfast: Berberine 500 mg + fish oil + magnesium + cinnamon or chromium.
- 10–15 min before lunch and dinner: Psyllium 5 g in water.
- Lunch: Berberine 500 mg.
- Mid-afternoon (away from berberine by 2–3 hours): Probiotic.
- Dinner: Berberine 500 mg + ALA or curcumin.
- Evening: Inositol (can split doses).

Key cautions
- Additive glucose-lowering: If combining multiple glucose agents (ALA, cinnamon, chromium, inositol) and/or diabetes medications, monitor for low blood sugar.
- Drug interactions: Berberine affects CYP3A4 and P‑gp; caution with drugs like cyclosporine/tacrolimus, certain statins (e.g., simvastatin, atorvastatin), calcium channel blockers, some antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and others. Piperine can further increase interactions.
- Separate berberine and probiotics/antibiotics by 2–3 hours due to antimicrobial activity.
- Not recommended in pregnancy/breastfeeding or for infants (risk of bilirubin issues).
- Start low (e.g., 500 mg once daily with food) to minimize GI upset; titrate to 500 mg 2–3x/day if tolerated.

These combinations are generally complementary; pick a few that match your goal (e.g., ALA + inositol for insulin resistance; omega‑3 + bergamot for lipids; silymarin + NAC for liver; fiber for postprandial control) rather than taking all at once."

Coenzyme in the electron transport chain → essential for ATP (cellular energy) production.

Improves mitochondrial efficiency and endurance.

Potent antioxidant → protects cells, blood vessels, and LDL cholesterol from oxidation.

Supports cardiovascular health (especially important since your LDL is elevated).

Enhances exercise performance and recovery.

Levels naturally decline with age — especially relevant at 49.

2. Synergies

✅ L-Carnitine + Riboflavin (B2) → amplify mitochondrial ATP production.

✅ Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) → improves fatty acid utilization alongside CoQ10.

✅ NR/NMN + TMG → synergistic with NAD+ for energy pathways.

✅ Omega-3 → combined cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory protection.

3. What NOT to Take it With

❌ Avoid taking with warfarin or strong anticoagulants without medical guidance (may reduce drug effectiveness).

❌ No need to take it with other fat-soluble antioxidants (like high-dose Vitamin E) at the exact same time — spread them out for best absorption.

4. Timing & Why

Morning with a fat-containing meal → CoQ10 is fat-soluble; absorption is significantly better with fats.

Can also be taken pre-workout for mitochondrial support and endurance.

Avoid late evening (mildly energizing in some).

5. Suggested Dosage (for you)

200–300 mg/day (ubiquinol form preferred).

Given your goals (fat loss, muscle, healing, cardiovascular optimization): 200 mg AM with Omega-3 is ideal.

6. Frequency

👉 CoQ10 is core for you right now: it directly addresses energy metabolism, fat loss, cardiovascular protection, and recovery. Combined with L-Carnitine, ALA, and Riboflavin, it’s part of your Mitochondrial Power Stack, which is one of your highest-priority protocols.",30 to 200 mg per day.,,,⚡ Energy / Mitochondria,,,"CoQ10 synergy cheat sheet (what to take together the same day)

Best pairs
- With fat: Take CoQ10 with a meal containing fat; ubiquinol form has better absorption. Split doses if >200 mg/day.
- Selenium (100–200 mcg/day, selenomethionine): Supports selenoenzymes that help recycle CoQ10; strong cardiovascular synergy, especially in low-selenium diets.
- Vitamin E + Vitamin C (e.g., E 100–200 IU mixed tocopherols; C 250–500 mg): Antioxidant network; CoQ10 helps regenerate vitamin E. Take with meals.
- PQQ (10–20 mg): Complements CoQ10 by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis while CoQ10 supports electron transport; good for energy/cognitive support.
- L‑Carnitine or Acetyl‑L‑Carnitine (ALCAR 500–1,500 mg or L‑carnitine tartrate 1–2 g): Enhances fatty acid transport into mitochondria; pairs well for energy and heart support.
- Alpha‑lipoic acid (300–600 mg; R‑ALA 100–300 mg): Antioxidant/mitochondrial support and insulin sensitivity; consider away from mineral supplements.
- Omega‑3s (EPA+DHA 1–2 g/day): Cardiometabolic synergy and anti-inflammatory effects; take with meals containing fat.
- B‑complex (focus on B2 riboflavin 10–50 mg and B3 niacinamide/niacin 50–250 mg): Coenzymes for mitochondrial energy production; morning with food.
- Magnesium (200–400 mg, e.g., glycinate): Required for ATP function; often best in evening.
- Creatine monohydrate (3–5 g): Complements cellular energy systems; any time.
- Resveratrol (100–200 mg): Endothelial and mitochondrial signaling (SIRT1/PGC‑1α) complements CoQ10’s electron transport role.
- Taurine (1–2 g): Cardiac and endothelial support; can pair with CoQ10 for heart health.
- NAC (600–1,200 mg): Supports glutathione; complements antioxidant network.

Simple same‑day stacks (pick one focus)
- Cardiovascular: CoQ10 100–200 mg (ubiquinol) + Selenium 100–200 mcg + Omega‑3 1–2 g + Vitamin E 100–200 IU (+ optional Magnesium 200–400 mg).
- Energy/fatigue: CoQ10 100–200 mg + PQQ 10–20 mg + ALCAR 1,000 mg + B‑complex (+ optional Creatine 3–5 g).
- Metabolic support: CoQ10 100–200 mg + ALA 300–600 mg + Omega‑3 1–2 g + Magnesium 200–400 mg.
- Cognitive: CoQ10 100–200 mg + PQQ 10–20 mg + ALCAR 500–1,000 mg + Resveratrol 100–200 mg.

Timing tips
- CoQ10, omega‑3, vitamin E, resveratrol, selenium: with meals (with fat).
- ALA: empty stomach if tolerated; otherwise with food; away from minerals.
- Magnesium: evening may aid relaxation.
- Creatine, taurine, NAC, B‑complex: flexible; B‑complex often in morning.

Cautions
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): CoQ10 may reduce INR; avoid or monitor closely with a clinician.
- Blood pressure or glucose‑lowering meds: CoQ10 can modestly lower BP and improve glycemic control; monitor.
- High‑dose antioxidants around intense training: very high doses (especially C/E) may blunt some training adaptations; moderate doses are typically fine.
- Selenium has a narrow optimal range; avoid exceeding 200 mcg/day long term unless advised."
Creatine,2x Daily,☀️ Morning: Fed,Have it,10,checked,checked,3372mg,Creatine,,checked,checked,,"Here’s the full structured breakdown for Creatine Monohydrate 👇

1. What it Does

Increases phosphocreatine stores in muscle → faster ATP regeneration → more strength & endurance.

Boosts muscle hypertrophy (water + protein synthesis in muscle cells).

Improves power output, sprint performance, and recovery.

Neuroprotective → supports brain energy metabolism.

May help reduce fatigue and improve training consistency.

2. Synergies

✅ Protein / Whey shakes → creatine uptake improves with insulin spike from protein/carbs.

✅ L-Carnitine + CoQ10 + ALA → full mitochondrial + energy synergy.

✅ Collagen + Glycine + Vitamin C → complements recovery and tendon/ligament strength (indirectly supports your foot healing).

✅ Resistance training → creatine works best when combined with consistent strength training.

3. What NOT to Take it With

❌ Avoid taking with large doses of caffeine at the exact same time (some evidence of reduced absorption/effect). Caffeine during the day is fine if creatine is taken post-gym.

❌ No need to combine with multiple “designer creatines” — monohydrate is best studied and most effective.

4. Timing & Why

Post-gym with protein shake → best absorption (insulin-driven uptake).

Can also be taken any time of day (daily saturation matters more than timing).

Take with plenty of water → improves solubility, reduces GI upset.

5. Suggested Dosage (for you)

5 g/day (standard maintenance dose).

No need to cycle; loading phase (20 g/day for 5 days) isn’t necessary if you’re consistent.

6. Frequency

Daily (even on rest days).

Cautions and spacing:
- Separate from multimineral/iron/copper/zinc supplements and activated charcoal by 2–3 hours (thiol binding/adsorption).
- May potentiate nitroglycerin and other nitrates (additive vasodilation); caution with antihypertensives and antiplatelets/anticoagulants (mild antiplatelet effect).
- Histamine‑prone or asthmatic individuals may react; start low and pair with vitamin C/quercetin.
- Not established in pregnancy/lactation; avoid unless advised by a clinician.
- If you have ulcers, recent surgery, or are on chemo, immunosuppressants, or complex regimens, consult a clinician before stacking."
5-HTP,When Needed,🌟 Mood,Have it,7,checked,,50mg,5-HTP,🌿 Stress / Mood Modulators,checked,,,"Here’s your structured breakdown for 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) 👇

1. What it Does

Direct precursor to serotonin → boosts mood, reduces anxiety.

Converts downstream to melatonin → supports sleep onset and circadian rhythm.

May reduce appetite and carb cravings (serotonin regulates satiety).

For you: helps with sleep depth, mood balance, and fat loss appetite control.

2. Synergies

✅ Magnesium + Glycine + Ashwagandha + GABA → amplifies sleep quality.

✅ Theanine → smooths serotonin increase for calm focus.

✅ Vitamin B6 → cofactor for serotonin/melatonin conversion.

✅ Collagen + Glycine → indirect synergy, since glycine also improves sleep.

3. What NOT to Take it With

❌ SSRIs or antidepressants → risk of serotonin syndrome (dangerously high serotonin).

❌ High-dose tryptophan supplements → redundancy, overshooting serotonin.

❌ Combining with all other calming aids at max dose (GABA + Ashwagandha + Magnesium + Theanine) → may cause morning grogginess.

4. Timing & Why

30–60 min before bed → supports serotonin → melatonin conversion → better sleep onset.

Can also be used early evening with dinner if mood/appetite control is main goal.

Take with a light snack (not heavy protein), since amino acids compete for absorption.

5. Suggested Dosage (for you)

100–200 mg nightly.

Start with 100 mg, scale up to 200 mg if sleep/mood needs it.

6. Frequency

As needed — best used during stressful phases, poor sleep cycles, or fat-loss phases with carb cravings.

Can be used daily, but I recommend rotation with your other sleep tools (Magnesium, Glycine, Ashwagandha, GABA, Theanine).

👉 5-HTP is a good tool, but not essential daily. You already have a strong sleep/recovery foundation (Magnesium + Glycine + Ashwagandha). Use 5-HTP on-demand for:

Jet lag nights,

High-stress phases,

Fat-loss carb cravings,
rather than as a nightly anchor.",,,,🌿 Stress / Mood Modulators,,,
Gaba,When Needed,🌟 Mood,Have it,7,checked,,500mg,GABA,🌿 Stress / Mood Modulators,checked,checked,,"Here’s your structured breakdown for GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) 👇

1. What it Does

Primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain → promotes relaxation and calm.

Helps reduce anxiety, stress, and nervous system hyperactivity.

Supports falling asleep faster and deeper sleep.

May improve growth hormone release when taken before sleep (supports muscle recovery).

For you: supports nervous system balance, sleep depth, and healing recovery.

2. Synergies

✅ Magnesium Glycinate/Taurate/Threonate → enhances calming effect.

✅ Glycine + 5-HTP + Ashwagandha → full sleep stack synergy.

✅ Theanine → promotes relaxed focus during the day if taken together in lower doses.

3. What NOT to Take it With

❌ Avoid combining with alcohol or sedative drugs → excessive CNS depression.

❌ High doses + other strong sleep aids (like 5-HTP + melatonin + GABA) may cause morning grogginess.

⚠️ Oral GABA has limited brain penetration; benefits are often from gut-brain signaling (still effective for calming).

4. Timing & Why

30–60 min before bed → improves relaxation and sleep onset.

Can also be used in the afternoon or evening if stress/anxiety spikes.

Take with or without food — absorption isn’t strongly affected by meals.

5. Suggested Dosage (for you)

100–500 mg per serving.

For you: 100–200 mg nightly with magnesium + glycine (baseline).

Up to 500 mg on stressful days or when sleep is disrupted.

6. Frequency

As needed (use on nights you need deeper calm).

Can be used daily at low doses for sleep, but best to rotate with other calming aids (glycine, ashwagandha, theanine).

👉 GABA is helpful for sleep and relaxation, but not essential daily since you already have Magnesium + Glycine + Ashwagandha (all strong calming agents). Think of GABA as an “on-demand tool” for nights of high stress, overtraining, or jet lag, rather than a core daily driver.",100mg,,,🌿 Stress / Mood Modulators,,,

Potent anti-inflammatory → blocks NF-κB pathway, lowering chronic inflammation.

Antioxidant → scavenges free radicals, supports recovery from training.

Protects joints, tendons, and connective tissue.

Supports liver health and gut barrier integrity.

May enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce LDL oxidation.

2. Synergies

✅ Piperine (black pepper extract) → boosts absorption of curcumin.

✅ Omega-3 → synergistic anti-inflammatory effect.

✅ Collagen + Glycine → joint/tendon healing + inflammation control.

✅ ALA + NAC + Selenium → multiplies antioxidant defense.

3. What NOT to Take it With

❌ High-dose blood thinners (warfarin, aspirin) → curcumin already thins blood.

❌ Take away from iron supplements → curcumin can chelate iron.

⚠️ If stacked with many strong antioxidants (ALA, resveratrol, astaxanthin) around workouts, may slightly blunt training adaptation.

4. Timing & Why

With food (especially fat-containing meals) → curcumin is fat-soluble, absorption is much higher.

Best taken morning or lunch → reduces daytime inflammation and joint stiffness.

Avoid late evening if you’re sensitive, as it can mildly stimulate.

5. Suggested Dosage (for you)

500–1000 mg/day of Curcumin Phytosome (Meriva® form is common).

Split into 2 doses (500 mg AM + 500 mg PM) if you want continuous anti-inflammatory coverage.

6. Frequency

Daily, especially during your fat loss + foot healing phase.

Long-term safe, but you can cycle down once inflammation markers are stable.
