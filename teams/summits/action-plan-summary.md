# Summit Strategy - Executive Action Plan
## Key Decisions & Immediate Next Steps

*Executive summary of all Bari Baumgardner insights + Tony Robbins proven model*

---

## 🚨 **THE CRITICAL INSIGHT**

> **Bari:** "Don't sell a 5-month $5K program. Pick ONE program (like Build Your AI Clone) and sell that."

**Tony's Proof:** $995 single offer generated **$20M revenue** from 700K free summit leads

---

## ❌ **WHAT'S BROKEN NOW** 

**From All Bari Meetings:**
1. **No unified methodology** - "Buffet-style" events vs. cohesive framework
2. **Celebrity backfire** - $250K for Gwyneth, people came for her, not the method
3. **Wrong sales timing** - Pitching too early (Day 2), closing too late (Day 3)
4. **Delayed sales process** - "Book a call" creates 2-week momentum loss  
5. **Complex offers** - 5-month $5K programs vs. simple focused promises
6. **Overwhelm epidemic** - Adding features instead of simplifying
7. **Missing logical buyers** - 70% female audience needs Q&A time to convert
8. **Wrong avatar targeting** - Vishen: "I assume everyone gets it as well as I do"
9. **Declining attendance** - Weekend dropoff due to family obligations

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 30 Days)**

### **Decision 1: Choose Pilot Topic**
**Recommendation: AI Mastery** (Tony proved this works)
- Create "AI Personal Assistant in 21 Days" framework
- Promise: "Reclaim 10+ hours per week guaranteed"

### **Decision 2: Summit Structure**
**Switch to Thu-Fri-Sat schedule** (respect family weekend time)
- Day 1: Method foundation (no selling)
- Day 2: Deep dive + main offer (emotional buyers)  
- Day 3: Q&A + final push (logical buyers)

### **Decision 3: Speaker Briefing**
**Every speaker serves the method** - no personal agendas
- Brief speakers on specific throughline role
- Prohibit off-topic content and personal pitches

### **Decision 4: Offer Simplification** 
**Single focused offer** instead of complex mastery
- $897-$995 price point (proven sweet spot)
- 21-day program vs. 5-month commitment  
- Outcome guarantee (10+ hours saved)

### **Decision 5: Live Sales Lobby** (NEW from Hour 2)
**Real-time sales support** vs. "book a call" delays
- Live Zoom rooms open during offer presentation
- Group Q&A with sales experts (like Tony's 1,200-person lobbies)
- Immediate momentum conversion vs. 2-week lag

### **Decision 6: Celebrity Integration** (NEW from Hour 2)  
**Strategic celebrity use** vs. standalone attractions
- Vishen as central figure (not equal billing)
- Celebrities serve specific method steps
- Test method-focused vs. celebrity-focused marketing

---

## 💰 **REVENUE MODEL**

### **Enhanced Free Summit Funnel** (with Hour 2 improvements):
```
100K Registrations → 10K Trial ($1) → 3.5K Main Offer ($995) → 6.5K Membership ($37/mo)
Revenue: $10K + $3.48M + $2.89M/year = $6.38M+ per summit
```

**Key Improvement:** Live sales lobby increases conversion from 2% to 3.5%
