### **4. Marketing Efficiency → Summit ROI Optimization**

**Bari's Goal:** Make summits profitable "pay day events" like Tony Robbins' model
**MarTech Strength:** Advanced attribution and efficiency measurement

**Strategic Implementations:**
- **MER Calculations** → True marketing efficiency ratio for Summit investment
- **Multi-Touch Attribution** → Which Summit moments actually drive enrollment
- **MMM Integration** → Incremental revenue impact of methodology-driven vs buffet summits
